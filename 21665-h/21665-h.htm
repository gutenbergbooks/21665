PUBLISHER’S NOTICE.</a></h4>

<hr>

<p>The present volume is the second part of the author’s “English
Language&mdash;Its Grammar, History, and Literature.” It includes the
History of the English Language and the History of English
Literature.</p>

<p>The first part comprises the department of Grammar, under which are
included Etymology, Syntax, Analysis, Word Formation, and History, with
a brief outline of Composition and of Prosody. The two may be had
separately or bound together. Each constitutes a good one year’s course
of English study. The first part is suited for high schools; the second,
for high schools and colleges.</p>

<p>The book, which is worthy of the wide reputation and ripe experience
of the eminent author, is distinguished throughout by clear, brief, and
comprehensive statement and illustration. It is especially suited for
private students or for classes desiring to make a brief and rapid
review, and also for teachers who want only a brief text as a basis for
their own instruction.</p>

PREFACE.</a></h4>

<hr>

<p>This book provides sufficient matter for the four years of study
required, in England, of a pupil-teacher, and also for the first year at
his training college. An experienced master will easily be able to guide
his pupils in the selection of the proper parts for each year. The ten
pages on the Grammar of Verse ought to be reserved for the fifth year of
study.</p>

<p>It is hoped that the book will also be useful in Colleges, Ladies’
Seminaries, High Schools, Academies, Preparatory and Normal Schools, to
candidates for teachers’ examinations and Civil Service examinations,
and to all who wish for any reason to review the leading facts of the
English Language and Literature.</p>

<p>Only the most salient features of the language have been described,
and minor details have been left for the teacher to fill in. The utmost
clearness and simplicity have been the aim of the writer, and he has
been obliged to sacrifice many interesting details to this aim.</p>

<p>The study of English Grammar is becoming every day more and more
historical&mdash;and necessarily so. There are scores of inflections,
usages, constructions, idioms, which cannot be truly or adequately
explained without a reference
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
<!--png 006-->
to the past states of the language&mdash;to the time when it was a
synthetic or inflected language, like German or Latin.</p>

<p>The Syntax of the language has been set forth in the form of <span
class = "smallcaps">Rules</span>. This was thought to be better for
young learners who require firm and clear dogmatic statements of fact
and duty. But the skilful teacher will slowly work up to these rules by
the interesting process of induction, and will&mdash;when it is
possible&mdash;induce his pupil to draw the general conclusions from the
data given, and thus to make rules for himself. Another convenience that
will be found by both teacher and pupil in this form of <i>rules</i>
will be that they can be compared with the rules of, or general
statements about, a&nbsp;foreign language&mdash;such as Latin, French,
or German.</p>

<p>It is earnestly hoped that the slight sketches of the History of our
Language and of its Literature may not only enable the young student to
pass his examinations with success, but may also throw him into the
attitude of mind of Oliver Twist, and induce him to “ask for more.”</p>

<p>The Index will be found useful in preparing the parts of each
subject; as all the separate paragraphs about the same subject will be
found there grouped together.</p>

INTRODUCTION.</a></h4>


<p><a name = "partIII_intro_sec1" id = "partIII_intro_sec1">1.</a>
<b>Tongue, Speech, Language.</b>&mdash;We speak of the “English tongue”
or of the “French language”; and we say of two nations that they “do not
understand each other’s speech.” The existence of these three
words&mdash;<b>speech</b>, <b>tongue</b>, <b>language</b>&mdash;proves
to us that a language is something <b>spoken</b>,&mdash;that it is a
number of <b>sounds</b>; and that the writing or printing of it upon
paper is a quite secondary matter. Language, rightly considered, then,
is an <b>organised set of sounds</b>. These sounds convey a meaning from
the mind of the speaker to the mind of the hearer, and thus serve to
connect man with man.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_intro_sec2" id = "partIII_intro_sec2">2.</a>
<b>Written Language.</b>&mdash;It took many hundreds of
years&mdash;perhaps thousands&mdash;before human beings were able to
invent a mode of writing upon paper&mdash;that is, of representing
<b>sounds</b> by <b>signs</b>. These signs are called <b>letters</b>;
and the whole set of them goes by the name of the
<b>Alphabet</b>&mdash;from the two first letters of the Greek alphabet,
which are called <i>alpha</i>, <i>beta</i>. There are languages that
have never been put upon paper at all, such as many of the African
languages, many in the South Sea Islands, and other parts of the globe.
But in all cases, every language that we know anything
about&mdash;English, Latin, French, German&mdash;existed for hundreds of
years before any one thought of writing it down on paper.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_intro_sec3" id = "partIII_intro_sec3">3.</a>
<b>A Language Grows.</b>&mdash;A language is an <b>organism</b> or
<b>organic existence</b>. Now every organism lives; and, if it lives, it
grows; and, if it grows, it also dies. Our language grows; it is growing
still; and it has been growing for many
<span class = "pagenum">194</span>
<!--png 012-->
hundreds of years. As it grows it loses something, and it gains
something else; it alters its appearance; changes take place in this
part of it and in that part,&mdash;until at length its appearance in age
is something almost entirely different from what it was in its early
youth. If we had the photograph of a man of forty, and the photograph of
the same person when he was a child of one, we should find, on comparing
them, that it was almost impossible to point to the smallest trace of
likeness in the features of the two photographs. And yet the two
pictures represent the same person. And so it is with the English
language. The oldest English, which is usually called Anglo-Saxon, is as
different from our modern English as if they were two distinct
languages; and yet they are not two languages, but really and
fundamentally one and the same. Modern English differs from the oldest
English as a giant oak does from a small oak sapling, or a broad
stalwart man of forty does from a feeble infant of a few months old.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_intro_sec4" id = "partIII_intro_sec4">4.</a>
<b>The English Language.</b>&mdash;The English language is the speech
spoken by the Anglo-Saxon race in England, in most parts of Scotland, in
the larger part of Ireland, in the United States, in Canada, in
Australia and New Zealand, in South Africa, and in many other parts of
the world. In the middle of the <b>fifth</b> century it was spoken by a
few thousand men who had lately landed in England from the Continent: it
is now spoken by more than one hundred millions of people. In the course
of the next sixty years, it will probably be the speech of two hundred
millions.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_intro_sec5" id = "partIII_intro_sec5">5.</a>
<b>English on the Continent.</b>&mdash;In the middle of the fifth
century it was spoken in the north-west corner of Europe&mdash;between
the mouths of the Rhine, the Weser, and the Elbe; and in Schleswig there
is a small district which is called <b>Angeln</b> to this day. But it
was not then called <b>English</b>; it was more probably called
<b>Teutish</b>, or <b>Teutsch</b>, or <b>Deutsch</b>&mdash;all words
connected with a generic word which covers many families and
languages&mdash;<b>Teutonic</b>. It was a rough guttural speech of one
or two thousand words; and it was brought over to this country by the
<b>Jutes</b>, <b>Angles</b>, and <b>Saxons</b> in the year 449. These
<span class = "pagenum">195</span>
<!--png 013-->
men left their home on the Continent to find here farms to till and
houses to live in; and they drove the inhabitants of the
island&mdash;the <b>Britons</b>&mdash;ever farther and farther west,
until they at length left them in peace in the more mountainous parts of
the island&mdash;in the southern and western corners, in Cornwall and in
Wales.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_intro_sec6" id = "partIII_intro_sec6">6.</a>
<b>The British Language.</b>&mdash;What language did the Teutonic
conquerors, who wrested the lands from the poor Britons, find spoken in
this island when they first set foot on it? Not a Teutonic speech at
all. They found a language not one word of which they could understand.
The island itself was then called <b>Britain</b>; and the tongue spoken
in it belonged to the Keltic group of languages. Languages belonging to
the Keltic group are still spoken in Wales, in Brittany (in France), in
the Highlands of Scotland, in the west of Ireland, and in the Isle of
Man. A&nbsp;few words&mdash;very few&mdash;from the speech of the
Britons, have come into our own English language; and what these are we
shall see by-and-by.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_intro_sec7" id = "partIII_intro_sec7">7.</a>
<b>The Family to which English belongs.</b>&mdash;Our English tongue
belongs to the <b>Aryan</b> or <b>Indo-European Family</b> of languages.
That is to say, the main part or substance of it can be traced back to
the race which inhabited the high table-lands that lie to the back of
the western end of the great range of the Himalaya, or “Abode of Snow.”
This Aryan race grew and increased, and spread to the south and west;
and from it have sprung languages which are now spoken in India, in
Persia, in Greece and Italy, in France and Germany, in Scandinavia, and
in Russia. From this Aryan family we are sprung; out of the oldest Aryan
speech our own language has grown.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_intro_sec8" id = "partIII_intro_sec8">8.</a>
<b>The Group to which English belongs.</b>&mdash;The Indo-European
family of languages consists of several groups. One of these is called
the <b>Teutonic Group</b>, because it is spoken by the <b>Teuts</b> (or
the <b>Teutonic race</b>), who are found in Germany, in England and
Scotland, in Holland, in parts of Belgium, in Denmark, in Norway and
Sweden, in Iceland, and the Faroe Islands. The Teutonic group consists
of three branches&mdash;<b>High German</b>, <b>Low German</b>, and
<b>Scandinavian</b>. High
<span class = "pagenum">196</span>
<!--png 014-->
German is the name given to the kind of German spoken in Upper
Germany&mdash;that is, in the table-land which lies south of the river
Main, and which rises gradually till it runs into the Alps. <b>New High
German</b> is the German of books&mdash;the literary language&mdash;the
German that is taught and learned in schools. <b>Low German</b> is the
name given to the German dialects spoken in the lowlands&mdash;in the
German part of the Great Plain of Europe, and round the mouths of those
German rivers that flow into the Baltic and the North Sea.
<b>Scandinavian</b> is the name given to the languages spoken in Denmark
and in the great Scandinavian Peninsula. Of these three languages,
Danish and Norwegian are practically the same&mdash;their literary or
book-language is one; while Swedish is very different. Icelandic is the
oldest and purest form of Scandinavian. The following is a table of

<p>It will be observed, on looking at the above table, that High German
is subdivided according to time, but that the other groups are
subdivided according to space.</p>

<b>English a Low-German Speech.</b>&mdash;Our English tongue is the
<b>lowest of all Low-German dialects</b>. Low German is the German
spoken in the lowlands of Germany. As we descend the rivers, we come to
the lowest level of all&mdash;the level of the sea. Our English speech,
once a mere dialect, came down to that, crossed the German Ocean, and
settled in Britain, to which it gave in time the name of Angla-land or
England. The Low German spoken in the Netherlands is called
<b>Dutch</b>; the Low German spoken in Friesland&mdash;a&nbsp;prosperous
province of Holland&mdash;is called <b>Frisian</b>; and the Low German
spoken in Great Britain is called <b>English</b>. These three languages
are extremely like one another; but the Continental language that is
likest
<span class = "pagenum">197</span>
<!--png 015-->
the English is the Dutch or Hollandish dialect called <i>Frisian</i>. We
even possess a couplet, every word of which is both English and Frisian.
It runs thus&mdash;</p>

<b>Dutch and Welsh&mdash;a Contrast.</b>&mdash;When the Teuton
conquerors came to this country, they called the Britons foreigners,
just as the Greeks called all other peoples besides themselves
<i>barbarians</i>. By this they did not at first mean that they were
uncivilised, but only that they were <i>not</i> Greeks. Now, the
Teutonic or Saxon or English name for foreigners was <b>Wealhas</b>,
a&nbsp;word afterwards contracted into <b>Welsh</b>. To this day the
modern Teuts or Teutons (or <i>Germans</i>, as <i>we</i> call them) call
all Frenchmen and Italians <i>Welshmen</i>; and, when a German, peasant
crosses the border into France, he says: “I&nbsp;am going into
Welshland.”</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_intro_sec11" id = "partIII_intro_sec11">11.</a>
<b>The Spread of English over Britain.</b>&mdash;The Jutes, who came
from Juteland or Jylland&mdash;now called Jutland&mdash;settled in Kent
and in the Isle of Wight. The Saxons settled in the south and western
parts of England, and gave their names to those kingdoms&mdash;now
counties&mdash;whose names came to end in <b>sex</b>. There was the
kingdom of the East Saxons, or <b>Essex</b>; the kingdom of the West
Saxons, or <b>Wessex</b>; the kingdom of the Middle Saxons, or
<b>Middlesex</b>; and the kingdom of the South Saxons, or <b>Sussex</b>.
The Angles settled chiefly on the east coast. The kingdom of <b>East
Anglia</b> was divided into the regions of the <b>North Folk</b> and the
<b>South Folk</b>, words which are still perpetuated in the names
<i>Norfolk</i> and <i>Suffolk</i>. These three sets of Teutons all spoke
different dialects of the same Teutonic speech; and these dialects, with
their differences, peculiarities, and odd habits, took root in English
soil, and lived an independent life, apart from each other, uninfluenced
by each other, for several hundreds of years. But, in the slow course of
time, they joined together to make up our beautiful English
language&mdash;a&nbsp;language which, however, still bears in itself the
traces of dialectic forms, and is in no respect of one kind or of one
fibre all through.</p>

<h6>THE PERIODS OF ENGLISH.</h6>


<p><a name = "partIII_chapI_sec1" id = "partIII_chapI_sec1">1.</a>
<b>Dead and Living Languages.</b>&mdash;A language is said to be dead
when it is no longer spoken. Such a language we know only in books.
Thus, Latin is a dead language, because no nation anywhere now speaks
it. A&nbsp;dead language can undergo no change; it remains, and must
remain, as we find it written in books. But a living language is always
changing, just like a tree or the human body. The human body has its
periods or stages. There is the period of infancy, the period of
boyhood, the period of manhood, and the period of old age. In the same
way, a&nbsp;language has its periods.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapI_sec2" id = "partIII_chapI_sec2">2.</a>
<b>No Sudden Changes&mdash;a Caution.</b>&mdash;We divide the English
language into periods, and then mark, with some approach to accuracy,
certain distinct changes in the habits of our language, in the
inflexions of its words, in the kind of words it preferred, or in the
way it liked to put its words together. But we must be carefully on our
guard against fancying that, at any given time or in any given year, the
English people threw aside one set of habits as regards language, and
adopted another set. It is not so, nor can it be so. The changes in
language are as gentle, gradual, and imperceptible as the changes in the
growth of a tree or in the skin of the human body. We renew our skin
slowly and gradually; but we are never conscious of the process, nor can
we say at any given time that we have got a completely new skin.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">199</span>
<!--png 017-->
<p><a name = "partIII_chapI_sec3" id = "partIII_chapI_sec3">3.</a>
<b>The Periods of English.</b>&mdash;Bearing this caution in mind, we
can go on to look at the chief periods in our English language. These
are five in number; and they are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary = "periods of English">
<tr>
<td class = "number">I.</td>
<td>Ancient English or Anglo-Saxon,</td>
<td class = "number">449-1100</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td class = "number">1603-1900</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>These periods merge very slowly, or are shaded off, so to speak, into
each other in the most gradual way. If we take the English of 1250 and
compare it with that of 900, we shall find a great difference; but if we
compare it with the English of 1100 the difference is not so marked. The
difference between the English of the nineteenth and the English of the
fourteenth century is very great, but the difference between the English
of the fourteenth and that of the thirteenth century is very small.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapI_sec4" id = "partIII_chapI_sec4">4.</a>
<b>Ancient English or Anglo-Saxon, 450-1100.</b>&mdash;This form of
English differed from modern English in having a much larger number of
inflexions. The noun had five cases, and there were several declensions,
just as in Latin; adjectives were declined, and had three genders; some
pronouns had a dual as well as a plural number; and the verb had a much
larger number of inflexions than it has now. The vocabulary of the
language contained very few foreign elements. The poetry of the language
employed head-rhyme or alliteration, and not end-rhyme, as we do now.
The works of the poet <b>Caedmon</b> and the great prose-writer <b>King
Alfred</b> belong to this Anglo-Saxon period.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapI_sec5" id = "partIII_chapI_sec5">5.</a>
<b>Early English, 1100-1250.</b>&mdash;The coming of the Normans in 1066
made many changes in the land, many changes in the Church and in the
State, and it also introduced many changes into the language. The
inflexions of our speech began to drop off, because they were used less
and less; and though we never adopted new <i>inflexions</i> from French
or from any other language, new French <i>words</i> began to creep in.
In some parts of the country English had ceased to be written in books;
the language existed as a spoken language only; and hence accuracy in
the use of words and the inflexions of words could not be
<span class = "pagenum">200</span>
<!--png 018-->
ensured. Two notable books&mdash;written, not printed, for there was no
printing in this island till the year 1474&mdash;belong to this period.
These are the <b>Ormulum</b>, by <b>Orm</b> or <b>Ormin</b>, and the
<b>Brut</b>, by a monk called <b>Layamon</b> or <b>Laweman</b>. The
latter tells the story of Brutus, who was believed to have been the son
of Æneas of Troy; to have escaped after the downfall of that city; to
have sailed through the Mediterranean, ever farther and farther to the
west; to have landed in Britain, settled here, and given the country its
name.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapI_sec6" id = "partIII_chapI_sec6">6.</a>
<b>Middle English, 1250-1485.</b>&mdash;Most of the inflexions of nouns
and adjectives have in this period&mdash;between the middle of the
thirteenth and the end of the fifteenth century&mdash;completely
disappeared. The inflexions of verbs are also greatly reduced in number.
The <b>strong</b><a class = "tag" name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href =
"#note1">1</a> mode of inflexion has ceased to be employed for verbs
that are new-comers, and the <b>weak</b> mode has been adopted in its
place. During the earlier part of this period, even country-people tried
to speak French, and in this and other modes many French words found
their way into English. A&nbsp;writer of the thirteenth century, John de
Trevisa, says that country-people “fondeth [that is, try] with great
bysynes for to speke Freynsch for to be more y-told of.” The
country-people did not succeed very well, as the ordinary proverb shows:
“Jack would be a gentleman if he could speak French.” Boys at school
were expected to turn their Latin into French, and in the courts of law
French only was allowed to be spoken. But in 1362 Edward III. gave his
assent to an Act of Parliament allowing English to be used instead of
Norman-French. “The yer of oure Lord,” says John de Trevisa,
“a&nbsp;thousond thre hondred foure score and fyve of the secunde Kyng
Richard after the conquest, in al the gramer scoles of Engelond children
leveth Freynsch, and construeth and turneth an Englysch.” To the first
half of this period belong a <b>Metrical Chronicle</b>, attributed to
<b>Robert of Gloucester</b>; <b>Langtoft’s</b> Metrical Chronicle,
translated by <b>Robert de Brunne</b>; the <b>Agenbite of Inwit</b>, by
Dan Michel of Northgate in Kent; and a few others. But to the second
<span class = "pagenum">201</span>
<!--png 019-->
half belong the rich and varied productions of <b>Geoffrey Chaucer</b>,
our first great poet and always one of our greatest writers; the
alliterative poems of <b>William Langley</b> or <b>Langlande</b>; the
more learned poems of <b>John Gower</b>; and the translation of the
Bible and theological works of the reformer <b>John Wyclif</b>.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapI_sec7" id = "partIII_chapI_sec7">7.</a>
<b>Tudor English, 1485-1603.</b>&mdash;Before the end of the sixteenth
century almost all our inflexions had disappeared. The great dramatist
Ben Jonson (1574-1637) laments the loss of the plural ending <b>en</b>
for verbs, because <i>wenten</i> and <i>hopen</i> were much more musical
and more useful in verse than <i>went</i> or <i>hope</i>; but its
recovery was already past praying for. This period is remarkable for the
introduction of an enormous number of Latin words, and this was due to
the new interest taken in the literature of the Romans&mdash;an interest
produced by what is called the <b>Revival of Letters</b>. But the most
striking, as it is also the most important fact relating to this period,
is the appearance of a group of dramatic writers, the greatest the world
has ever seen. Chief among these was <b>William Shakespeare</b>. Of pure
poetry perhaps the greatest writer was <b>Edmund Spenser</b>. The
greatest prose-writer was <b>Richard Hooker</b>, and the pithiest
<b>Francis Bacon</b>.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapI_sec8" id = "partIII_chapI_sec8">8.</a>
<b>Modern English, 1603-1900.</b>&mdash;The grammar of the language was
fixed before this period, most of the accidence having entirely
vanished. The vocabulary of the language, however, has gone on
increasing, and is still increasing; for the English language, like the
English people, is always ready to offer hospitality to all peaceful
foreigners&mdash;words or human beings&mdash;that will land and settle
within her coasts. And the tendency at the present time is not only to
give a hearty welcome to newcomers from other lands, but to call back
old words and old phrases that had been allowed to drop out of
existence. Tennyson has been one of the chief agents in this happy
restoration.</p>

<h6>THE HISTORY OF THE VOCABULARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.</h6>


<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec1" id = "partIII_chapII_sec1">1.</a>
<b>The English Nation.</b>&mdash;The English people have for many
centuries been the greatest travellers in the world. It was an
Englishman&mdash;Francis Drake&mdash;who first went round the globe; and
the English have colonised more foreign lands in every part of the world
than any other people that ever existed. The English in this way have
been influenced by the world without. But they have also been subjected
to manifold influences from within&mdash;they have been exposed to
greater political changes, and profounder though quieter political
revolutions, than any other nation. In 1066 they were conquered by the
Norman-French; and for several centuries they had French kings. Seeing
and talking with many different peoples, they learned to adopt foreign
words with ease, and to give them a home among the native-born words of
the language. Trade is always a kindly and useful influence; and the
trade of Great Britain has for many centuries been larger than that of
any other nation. It has spread into every part of the world; it gives
and receives from all tribes and nations, from every speech and
tongue.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec2" id = "partIII_chapII_sec2">2.</a>
<b>The English Element in English.</b>&mdash;When the English came to
this island in the fifth century, the number of words in the language
they spoke was probably not over <b>two thousand</b>. Now, however, we
possess a vocabulary of perhaps more than <b>one hundred thousand
words</b>. And so eager and willing
<span class = "pagenum">203</span>
<!--png 021-->
have we been to welcome foreign words, that it may be said with truth
that: <b>The majority of words in the English Tongue are not
English</b>. In fact, if we take the Latin language by itself, there are
in our language more <b>Latin</b> words than <b>English</b>. But the
grammar is distinctly English, and not Latin at all.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec3" id = "partIII_chapII_sec3">3.</a>
<b>The Spoken Language and the Written
Language&mdash;a&nbsp;Caution.</b>&mdash;We must not forget what has
been said about a language,&mdash;that it is not a printed
thing&mdash;not a set of black marks upon paper, but that it is in
truest truth a <b>tongue</b> or a <b>speech</b>. Hence we must be
careful to distinguish between the <b>spoken</b> language and the
<b>written</b> or <b>printed</b> language; between the language of the
<b>ear</b> and the language of the <b>eye</b>; between the language of
the <b>mouth</b> and the language of the <b>dictionary</b>; between the
<b>moving</b> vocabulary of the market and the street, and the
<b>fixed</b> vocabulary that has been catalogued and imprisoned in our
dictionaries. If we can only keep this in view, we shall find that,
though there are more Latin words in our vocabulary than English, the
English words we possess are <b>used</b> in speaking a hundred times, or
even a thousand times, oftener than the Latin words. It is the genuine
English words that have life and movement; it is they that fly about in
houses, in streets, and in markets; it is they that express with
greatest force our truest and most usual sentiments&mdash;our inmost
thoughts and our deepest feelings. Latin words are found often enough in
books; but, when an English man or woman is deeply moved, he speaks pure
English and nothing else. Words are the coin of human intercourse; and
it is the native coin of pure English with the native stamp that is in
daily circulation.</p>

eye the proportions of the different elements in our vocabulary, as it

<b>The Foreign Elements in our English Vocabulary.</b>&mdash;The
different peoples and the different circumstances with which we have
come in contact, have had many results&mdash;one among others, that of
presenting us with contributions to our vocabulary. We found Kelts here;
and hence we have a number of Keltic words in our vocabulary. The Romans
held this island for several hundred years; and when they had to go in
the year 410, they left behind them six Latin words, which we have
inherited. In the seventh century, Augustine and his missionary monks
from Rome brought over to us a larger number of Latin words; and the
Church which they founded introduced ever more and more words from Rome.
The Danes began to come over to this island in the eighth century; we
had for some time a Danish dynasty seated on the throne of England: and
hence we possess many Danish words. The Norman-French invasion in the
eleventh century brought us many hundreds of Latin words; for French is
in reality a branch of the Latin tongue. The Revival of Learning in the
sixteenth century gave us several thousands of Latin words. And wherever
our sailors and merchants have gone, they have brought back with them
foreign words as well as foreign things&mdash;Arabic words from Arabia
and Africa, Hindustani words from India, Persian words from Persia,
Chinese words from China, and even Malay words from the peninsula of
Malacca. Let us look a little more closely at these foreign
elements.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec6" id = "partIII_chapII_sec6">6.</a>
<b>The Keltic Element in English.</b>&mdash;This element is of
<span class = "pagenum">205</span>
<!--png 023-->
three kinds: (i)&nbsp;Those words which we received direct from the
ancient Britons whom we found in the island; (ii)&nbsp;those which the
Norman-French brought with them from Gaul; (iii)&nbsp;those which have
lately come into the language from the Highlands of Scotland, or from
Ireland, or from the writings of Sir Walter Scott.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec7" id = "partIII_chapII_sec7">7.</a>
<b>The First Keltic Element.</b>&mdash;This first contribution contains
the following words: <i>Breeches</i>, <i>clout</i>, <i>crock</i>,
<i>cradle</i>, <i>darn</i>, <i>dainty</i>,<i> mop</i>, <i>pillow</i>;
<i>barrow</i> (a&nbsp;funeral mound), <i>glen</i>, <i>havoc</i>,
<i>kiln</i>, <i>mattock</i>, <i>pool</i>. It is worthy of note that the
first eight in the list are the names of domestic&mdash;some even of
kitchen&mdash;things and utensils. It may, perhaps, be permitted us to
conjecture that in many cases the Saxon invader married a British wife,
who spoke her own language, taught her children to speak their mother
tongue, and whose words took firm root in the kitchen of the new English
household. The names of most rivers, mountains, lakes, and hills are, of
course, Keltic; for these names would not be likely to be changed by the
English new-comers. There are two names for rivers which are
found&mdash;in one form or another&mdash;in every part of Great Britain.
These are the names <b>Avon</b> and <b>Ex</b>. The word <b>Avon</b>
means simply <i>water</i>. We can conceive the children on a farm near a
river speaking of it simply as “the water”; and hence we find fourteen
Avons in this island. <b>Ex</b> also means <i>water</i>; and there are
perhaps more than twenty streams in Great Britain with this name. The
word appears as <b>Ex</b> in <b>Exeter</b> (the older and fuller form
being <i>Exanceaster</i>&mdash;the camp on the Exe); as <b>Ax</b> in
<b>Axminster</b>; as <b>Ox</b> in <b>Oxford</b>; as <b>Ux</b> in
<b>Uxbridge</b>; and as <b>Ouse</b> in Yorkshire and other eastern
counties. In Wales and Scotland, the hidden <b>k</b> changes its place
and comes at the end. Thus in Wales we find <b>Usk</b>; and in Scotland,
<b>Esk</b>. There are at least eight Esks in the kingdom of Scotland
alone. The commonest Keltic name for a mountain is <b>Pen</b> or
<b>Ben</b> (in&nbsp;Wales it is <i>Pen</i>; in Scotland the flatter form
<i>Ben</i> is used). We find this word in England also under the form of
<b>Pennine</b>; and, in Italy, as <b>Apennine</b>.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec8" id = "partIII_chapII_sec8">8.</a>
<b>The Second Keltic Element.</b>&mdash;The Normans came from
<span class = "pagenum">206</span>
<!--png 024-->
Scandinavia early in the tenth century, and wrested the valley of the
Seine out of the hands of Charles the Simple, the then king of the
French. The language spoken by the people of France was a broken-down
form of spoken Latin, which is now called French; but in this language
they had retained many Gaulish words out of the old Gaulish language.
Such are the words: <i>Bag</i>, <i>bargain</i>, <i>barter</i>;
<i>barrel</i>, <i>basin</i>, <i>basket</i>, <i>bucket</i>;
<i>bonnet</i>, <i>button</i>, <i>ribbon</i>; <i>car</i>, <i>cart</i>;
<i>dagger</i>, <i>gown</i>; <i>mitten</i>, <i>motley</i>; <i>rogue</i>;
<i>varlet</i>, <i>vassal</i>, <i>wicket</i>. The above words were
brought over to Britain by the Normans; and they gradually took an
acknowledged place among the words of our own language, and have held
that place ever since.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec9" id = "partIII_chapII_sec9">9.</a>
<b>The Third Keltic Element.</b>&mdash;This consists of comparatively
few words&mdash;such as <i>clan</i>; <i>claymore</i> (a&nbsp;sword);
<i>philabeg</i> (a&nbsp;kind of kilt), <i>kilt</i> itself, <i>brogue</i>
(a&nbsp;kind of shoe), <i>plaid</i>; <i>pibroch</i> (bagpipe war-music),
<i>slogan</i> (a&nbsp;war-cry); and <i>whisky</i>. Ireland has given us
<i>shamrock</i>, <i>gag</i>, <i>log</i>, <i>clog</i>, and
<i>brogue</i>&mdash;in the sense of a mode of speech.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec10" id = "partIII_chapII_sec10">10.</a>
<b>The Scandinavian Element in English.</b>&mdash;Towards the end of the
eighth century&mdash;in the year 787&mdash;the Teutons of the North,
called Northmen, Normans, or Norsemen&mdash;but more commonly known as
Danes&mdash;made their appearance on the eastern coast of Great Britain,
and attacked the peaceful towns and quiet settlements of the English.
These attacks became so frequent, and their occurrence was so much
dreaded, that a prayer was inserted against them in a Litany of the
time&mdash;“From the incursions of the Northmen, good Lord, deliver us!”
In spite of the resistance of the English, the Danes had, before the end
of the ninth century, succeeded in obtaining a permanent footing in
England; and, in the eleventh century, a&nbsp;Danish dynasty sat upon
the English throne from the year 1016 to 1042. From the time of King
Alfred, the Danes of the Danelagh were a settled part of the population
of England; and hence we find, especially on the east coast,
a&nbsp;large number of Danish names still in use.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec11" id = "partIII_chapII_sec11">11.</a>
<b>Character of the Scandinavian Element.</b>&mdash;The Northmen, as we
have said, were Teutons; and they spoke a dialect
<span class = "pagenum">207</span>
<!--png 025-->
of the great Teutonic (or&nbsp;German) language. The sounds of the
Danish dialect&mdash;or language, as it must now be called&mdash;are
harder than those of the German. We find a <b>k</b> instead of a
<b>ch</b>; a&nbsp;<b>p</b> preferred to an <b>f</b>. The same is the
case in Scotland, where the hard form <b>kirk</b> is preferred to the
softer <b>church</b>. Where the Germans say <b>Dorf</b>&mdash;our
English word <b>Thorpe</b>, a&nbsp;village&mdash;the Danes say
<b>Drup</b>.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec12" id = "partIII_chapII_sec12">12.</a>
<b>Scandinavian Words</b> (i).&mdash;The words contributed to our
language by the Scandinavians are of two kinds: (i)&nbsp;Names of
places; and (ii)&nbsp;ordinary words. (i)&nbsp;The most striking
instance of a Danish place-name is the noun <b>by</b>, a&nbsp;town.
Mr&nbsp;Isaac Taylor<a class = "tag" name = "tag2" id = "tag2" href =
"#note2">2</a> tells us that there are in the east of England more than
six hundred names of towns ending in <b>by</b>. Almost all of these are
found in the Danelagh, within the limits of the great highway made by
the Romans to the north-west, and well-known as <b>Watling Street</b>.
We find, for example, <b>Whitby</b>, or the town on the <i>white</i>
cliffs; <b>Grimsby</b>, or the town of Grim, a&nbsp;great sea-rover, who
obtained for his countrymen the right that all ships from the Baltic
should come into the port of Grimsby free of duty; <b>Tenby</b>, that is
<b>Daneby</b>; <b>by-law</b>, a&nbsp;law for a special town; and a vast
number of others. The following Danish words also exist in our
times&mdash;either as separate and individual words, or in
composition&mdash;<b>beck</b>, a&nbsp;stream; <b>fell</b>, a&nbsp;hill
or table-land; <b>firth</b> or <b>fiord</b>, an arm of the sea&mdash;the
same as the Danish fiord; <b>force</b>, a&nbsp;waterfall; <b>garth</b>,
a&nbsp;yard or enclosure; <b>holm</b>, an island in a river;
<b>kirk</b>, a&nbsp;church; <b>oe</b>, an island; <b>thorpe</b>,

<b>Scandinavian Words</b> (ii).&mdash;The most useful and the most
frequently employed word that we have received from the Danes is the
word <b>are</b>. The pure English word for this is <b>beoth</b> or
<b>sindon</b>. The Danes gave us also the habit of using <b>to</b>
before an infinitive. Their word for <b>to</b> was <b>at</b>; and
<b>at</b> still survives and is in use in Lincolnshire. We find also the
following Danish words in our language: <b>blunt</b>, <b>bole</b>
(of&nbsp;a tree), <b>bound</b> (on&nbsp;a journey&mdash;properly
<b>boun</b>), <b>busk</b> (to&nbsp;dress), <b>cake</b>,
<span class = "pagenum">208</span>

<b>call</b>, <b>crop</b> (to&nbsp;cut), <b>curl</b>, <b>cut</b>,
<b>dairy</b>, <b>daze</b>, <b>din</b>, <b>droop</b>, <b>fellow</b>,
<b>flit</b>, <b>for</b>, <b>froward</b>, <b>hustings</b>, <b>ill</b>,
<b>irk</b>, <b>kid</b>, <b>kindle</b>, <b>loft</b>, <b>odd</b>,
<b>plough</b>, <b>root</b>, <b>scold</b>, <b>sky</b>, <b>tarn</b>
(a&nbsp;small mountain lake), <b>weak</b>, and <b>ugly</b>. It is in
Northumberland, Durham, Yorkshire, Lincoln, Norfolk, and even in the
western counties of Cumberland and Lancashire, that we find the largest
admixture of Scandinavian words.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec14" id = "partIII_chapII_sec14">14.</a>
<b>Influence of the Scandinavian Element.</b>&mdash;The introduction of
the Danes and the Danish language into England had the result, in the
east, of unsettling the inflexions of our language, and thus of
preparing the way for their complete disappearance. The declensions of
nouns became unsettled; nouns that used to make their plural in <b>a</b>
or in <b>u</b> took the more striking plural suffix <b>as</b> that
belonged to a quite different declension. The same things happened to
adjectives, verbs, and other parts of language. The causes of this are
not far to seek. Spoken language can never be so accurate as written
language; the mass of the English and Danes never cared or could care
much for grammar; and both parties to a conversation would of course
hold firmly to the <b>root</b> of the word, which was intelligible to
both of them, and let the inflexions slide, or take care of themselves.
The more the English and Danes mixed with each other, the oftener they
met at church, at games, and in the market-place, the more rapidly would
this process of stripping go on,&mdash;the smaller care would both
peoples take of the grammatical inflexions which they had brought with
them into this country.</p>

<b>The Latin Element in English.</b>&mdash;So far as the number of
words&mdash;the vocabulary&mdash;of the language is concerned, the Latin
contribution is by far the most important element in our language. Latin
was the language of the Romans; and the Romans at one time were masters
of the whole known world. No wonder, then, that they influenced so many
peoples, and that their language found its way&mdash;east and west, and
south and north&mdash;into almost all the countries of Europe. There
are, as we have seen, more Latin than English words in our own language;
and it is therefore necessary to make ourselves acquainted with the
<span class = "pagenum">209</span>
<!--png 027-->
character and the uses of the Latin element&mdash;an element so
important&mdash;in English.<a class = "tag" name = "tag3" id = "tag3"
href = "#note3">3</a> Not only have the Romans made contributions of
large <b>numbers</b> of words to the English language, but they have
added to it a quite new <b>quality</b>, and given to its genius new
<b>powers</b> of expression. So true is this, that we may
say&mdash;without any sense of unfairness, or any feeling of
exaggeration&mdash;that, until the Latin element was thoroughly mixed,
united with, and transfused into the original English, the writings of
Shakespeare were impossible, the poetry of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries could not have come into existence. This is true of
Shakespeare; and it is still more true of Milton. His most powerful
poetical thoughts are written in lines, the most telling words in which
are almost always Latin. This may be illustrated by the following lines
from “Lycidas”:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“It was that <i>fatal</i> and <i>perfidious</i> bark,</p>
<p>Built in the <i>eclipse</i>, and rigged with curses dark,</p>
<p>That sunk so low that <i>sacred</i> head of thine!”</p>

<b>The Latin Contributions and their Dates.</b>&mdash;The first
contribution of Latin words was made by the Romans&mdash;not, however,
to the English, but to the Britons. The Romans held this island from
<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> <b>43</b> to <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> <b>410</b>. They left behind them&mdash;when
they were obliged to go&mdash;a&nbsp;small contribution of six
words&mdash;six only, but all of them important. The second
contribution&mdash;to a large extent ecclesiastical&mdash;was made by
Augustine and his missionary monks from Rome, and their visit took place
in the year <b>596</b>. The third contribution was made through the
medium of the Norman-French, who seized and subdued this island in the
year <b>1066</b> and following years. The fourth contribution came to us
by the aid of the Revival of Learning&mdash;rather a process than an
event, the dates of which are vague, but which may be said to have taken
place in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The Latin left for us
by the Romans is called <b>Latin of the First Period</b>; that brought
over by the missionaries from Rome, <b>Latin of the</b>
<span class = "pagenum">210</span>
<!--png 028-->
<b>Second Period</b>; that given us by the Norman-French, <b>Latin of
the Third Period</b>; and that which came to us from the Revival of
Learning, <b>Latin of the Fourth Period</b>. The first consists of a few
names handed down to us through the Britons; the second, of a number of
words&mdash;mostly relating to ecclesiastical affairs&mdash;brought into
the spoken language by the monks; the third, of a large vocabulary, that
came to us by <b>mouth</b> and <b>ear</b>; and the fourth, of a very
large treasure of words, which we received by means of <b>books</b> and
the <b>eye</b>. Let us now look more closely and carefully at them, each
in its turn.</p>

<ins class = "correction" title = "printed as ‘...Period.--(i)’"><b>Latin of the First Period</b> (i).&mdash;</ins>The
Romans held Britain for nearly four hundred years; and they succeeded in
teaching the wealthier classes among the Southern Britons to speak
Latin. They also built towns in the island, made splendid roads, formed
camps at important points, framed good laws, and administered the
affairs of the island with considerable justice and uprightness. But,
never having come directly into contact with the Angles or Saxons
themselves, they could not in any way influence their language by oral
communication&mdash;by speaking to them. What they left behind them was
only six words, most of which became merely the prefixes or the suffixes
of the names of places. These six words were <b>Castra</b>, a&nbsp;camp;
<b>Strata</b> (<i>via</i>), a&nbsp;paved road; <b>Colonia</b>,
a&nbsp;settlement (generally of soldiers); <b>Fossa</b>, a&nbsp;trench;
<b>Portus</b>, a&nbsp;harbour; and <b>Vallum</b>, a&nbsp;rampart.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec18" id = "partIII_chapII_sec18">18.</a>
<b>Latin of the First Period</b> (ii).&mdash;(<i>a</i>) The treatment of
the Latin word <b>castra</b> in this island has been both singular and
significant. It has existed in this country for nearly nineteen hundred
years; and it has always taken the colouring of the locality into whose
soil it struck root. In the north and east of England it is sounded
hard, and takes the form of <b>caster</b>, as in <b>Lancaster</b>,
<b>Doncaster</b>, <b>Tadcaster</b>, and others. In the midland counties,
it takes the softer form of <b>cester</b>, as in <b>Leicester</b>,
<b>Towcester</b>; and in the extreme west and south, it takes the still
softer form of <b>chester</b>, as in <b>Chester</b>, <b>Manchester</b>,
<b>Winchester</b>, and others. It is worthy of notice that there are in
Scotland no words ending in <i>caster</i>. Though
<span class = "pagenum">211</span>
<!--png 029-->
the Romans had camps in Scotland, they do not seem to have been so
important as to become the centres of towns. (<i>b</i>) The word
<b>strata</b> has also taken different forms in different parts of
England. While <b>castra</b> has always been a suffix, <b>strata</b>
shows itself constantly as a prefix. When the Romans came to this
island, the country was impassable by man. There were no roads worthy of
the name,&mdash;what paths there were being merely foot-paths or
bridle-tracks. One of the first things the Romans did was to drive a
strongly built military road from <b>Richborough</b>, near Dover, to the
river Dee, on which they formed a standing camp (<b>Castra stativa</b>)
which to this day bears the name of <b>Chester</b>. This great road
became the highway of all travellers from north to south,&mdash;was
known as “The Street,” and was called by the Saxons <b>Watling
Street</b>. But this word <b>street</b> also became a much-used prefix,
and took the different forms of <b>strat</b>, <b>strad</b>,
<b>stret</b>, and <b>streat</b>. All towns with such names are to be
found on this or some other great Roman road. Thus we have
<b>Stratford-on-Avon</b>, <b>Stratton</b>, <b>Stradbroke</b>,
<b>Stretton</b>, <b>Stretford</b> (near Manchester), and
<b>Streatham</b> (near London).&mdash;Over the other words we need not
dwell so long. <b>Colonia</b> we find in <b>Colne</b>, <b>Lincoln</b>,
and others; <b>fossa</b> in <b>Fossway</b>, <b>Fosbrooke</b>, and
<b>Fosbridge</b>; <b>portus</b>, in <b>Portsmouth</b>, and
<b>Bridport</b>; and <b>vallum</b> in the words <b>wall</b>,
<b>bailey</b>, and <b>bailiff</b>. The Normans called the two courts in
front of their castles the inner and outer baileys; and the officer in
charge of them was called the bailiff.</p>

<b>Latin Element of the Second Period</b> (i).&mdash;The story of Pope
Gregory and the Roman mission to England is widely known. Gregory, when
a young man, was crossing the Roman forum one morning, and, when passing
the side where the slave-mart was held, observed, as he walked, some
beautiful boys, with fair hair, blue eyes, and clear bright complexion.
He asked a bystander of what nation the boys were. The answer was, that
they were Angles. “No, not Angles,” he replied; “they are angels.” On
learning further that they were heathens, he registered a silent vow
that he would, if Providence gave him an opportunity, deliver them from
the
<span class = "pagenum">212</span>
<!--png 030-->
darkness of heathendom, and bring them and their relatives into the
light and liberty of the Gospel. Time passed by; and in the long course
of time Gregory became Pope. In his unlooked-for greatness, he did not
forget his vow. In the year 596 he sent over to Kent a missionary,
called Augustine, along with forty monks. They were well received by the
King of Kent, allowed to settle in Canterbury, and to build a small
cathedral there.</p>

<b>Latin Element of the Second Period</b> (ii).&mdash;This mission, the
churches that grew out of it, the Christian customs that in time took
root in the country, and the trade that followed in its track, brought
into the language a number of Latin words, most of them the names of
church offices, services, and observances. Thus we find, in our oldest
English, the words, <b>postol</b> from <i>apostolus</i>, a&nbsp;person
sent; <b>biscop</b>, from <i>episcopus</i>, an overseer; <b>calc</b>,
from <i>calix</i>, a&nbsp;cup; <b>clerc</b>, from <i>clericus</i>, an
ordained member of the church; <b>munec</b>, from <i>monăchus</i>,
a&nbsp;solitary person or monk; <b>preost</b>, from <i>presbyter</i>, an
elder; <b>aelmesse</b>, from <i>eleēmosŭnē</i>, alms; <b>predician</b>,
from <i>prædicare</i>, to preach; <b>regol</b>, from <i>regula</i>,
a&nbsp;rule. (<i>Apostle</i>, <i>bishop</i>, <i>clerk</i>, <i>monk</i>,
<i>priest</i>, and <i>alms</i> come to us really from Greek
words&mdash;but through the Latin tongue.)</p>

<b>Latin Element of the Second Period</b> (iii).&mdash;The introduction
of the Roman form of Christianity brought with it increased
communication with Rome and with the Continent generally; widened the
experience of Englishmen; gave a stimulus to commerce; and introduced
into this island new things and products, and along with the things and
products new names. To this period belongs the introduction of the
words: <b>Butter</b>, <b>cheese</b>; <b>cedar</b>, <b>fig</b>,
<b>pear</b>, <b>peach</b>; <b>lettuce, lily</b>; <b>pepper</b>,
<b>pease</b>; <b>camel</b>, <b>lion</b>, <b>elephant</b>; <b>oyster</b>,
<b>trout</b>; <b>pound</b>, <b>ounce</b>; <b>candle</b>, <b>table</b>;
<b>marble</b>; <b>mint</b>.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec22" id = "partIII_chapII_sec22">22.</a>
<b>Latin of the Third Period</b> (i).&mdash;The Latin element of the
Third Period is in reality the French that was brought over to this
island by the Normans in 1066, and is generally called
<b>Norman-French</b>. It differed from the French of Paris both in
spelling and in pronunciation. For example, Norman-French
<span class = "pagenum">213</span>
<!--png 031-->
wrote <b>people</b> for <b>peuple</b>; <b>léal</b> for <b>loyal</b>;
<b>réal</b> for <b>royal</b>; <b>réalm</b> for <b>royaume</b>; and so
on. But both of these dialects (and every dialect of French) are simply
forms of Latin&mdash;not of the Latin written and printed in books, but
of the Latin spoken in the camp, the fields, the streets, the village,
and the cottage. The Romans conquered Gaul, where a Keltic tongue was
spoken; and the Gauls gradually adopted Latin as their mother tongue,
and&mdash;with the exception of the Brétons of Brittany&mdash;left off
their Keltic speech almost entirely. In adopting the Latin tongue, they
had&mdash;as in similar cases&mdash;taken firm hold of the root of the
word, but changed the pronunciation of it, and had, at the same time,
compressed very much or entirely dropped many of the Latin inflexions.
The French people, an intermixture of Gauls and other tribes (some of
them, like the Franks, German), ceased, in fact, to speak their own
language, and learned the Latin tongue. The Norsemen, led by Duke Rolf
or Rollo or Rou, marched south in large numbers; and, in the year 912,
wrested from King Charles the Simple the fair valley of the Seine,
settled in it, and gave to it the name of Normandy. These Norsemen, now
Normans, were Teutons, and spoke a Teutonic dialect; but, when they
settled in France, they learned in course of time to speak French. The
kind of French they spoke is called Norman-French, and it was this kind
of French that they brought over with them in 1066. But Norman-French
had made its appearance in England before the famous year of ’66; for
Edward the Confessor, who succeeded to the English throne in 1042, had
been educated at the Norman Court; and he not only spoke the language
himself, but insisted on its being spoken by the nobles who lived with
him in his Court.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec23" id = "partIII_chapII_sec23">23.</a>
<b>Latin of the Third Period</b> (ii). <b>Chief Dates</b>.&mdash;The
Normans, having utterly beaten down the resistance of the English,
seized the land and all the political power of this country, and filled
all kinds of offices&mdash;both spiritual and temporal&mdash;with their
Norman brethren. Norman-French became the language of the Court and the
nobility, the language of Parliament and the law courts, of the
universities and the schools, of the Church
<span class = "pagenum">214</span>
<!--png 032-->
and of literature. The English people held fast to their own tongue; but
they picked up many French words in the markets and other places “where
men most do congregate.” But French, being the language of the upper and
ruling classes, was here and there learned by the English or Saxon
country-people who had the ambition to be in the fashion, and were eager
“to speke Frensch, for to be more y-told of,”&mdash;to be more highly
considered than their neighbours. It took about three hundred years for
French words and phrases to soak thoroughly into English; and it was not
until England was saturated with French words and French rhythms that
the great poet Chaucer appeared to produce poetic narratives that were
read with delight both by Norman baron and by Saxon yeoman. In the
course of these three hundred years this intermixture of French with
English had been slowly and silently going on. Let us look at a few of
the chief land-marks in the long process. In <b>1042</b> Edward the
Confessor introduces Norman-French into his Court. In <b>1066</b> Duke
William introduces Norman-French into the whole country, and even into
parts of Scotland. The oldest English, or Anglo-Saxon, ceases to be
written, anywhere in the island, in public documents, in the year
<b>1154</b>. In <b>1204</b> we lost Normandy, a&nbsp;loss that had the
effect of bringing the English and the Normans closer together. Robert
of Gloucester writes his chronicle in <b>1272</b>, and uses a large
number of French words. But, as early as the reign of Henry the Third,
in the year <b>1258</b>, the reformed and reforming Government of the
day issued a proclamation in English, as well as in French and Latin. In
<b>1303</b>, Robert of Brunn introduces a large number of French words.
The French wars in Edward the Third’s reign brought about a still closer
union of the Norman and the Saxon elements of the nation. But, about the
middle of the fourteenth century a reaction set in, and it seemed as if
the genius of the English language refused to take in any more French
words. The English silent stubbornness seemed to have prevailed, and
Englishmen had made up their minds to be English in speech, as they were
English to the backbone in everything else. Norman-French had, in fact,
become provincial, and was spoken
<span class = "pagenum">215</span>
<!--png 033-->
only here and there. Before the great Plague&mdash;commonly spoken of as
“The Black Death”&mdash;of <b>1349</b>, both high and low seemed to be
alike bent on learning French, but the reaction may be said to date from
this year. The culminating point of this reaction may perhaps be seen in
an Act of Parliament passed in <b>1362</b> by Edward III., by which both
French and Latin had to give place to English in our courts of law. The
poems of Chaucer are the literary result&mdash;“the bright consummate
flower” of the union of two great powers&mdash;the brilliance of the
French language on the one hand and the homely truth and steadfastness
of English on the other. Chaucer was born in <b>1340</b>, and died in
<b>1400</b>; so that we may say that he and his poems&mdash;though not
the causes&mdash;are the signs and symbols of the great influence that
French obtained and held over our mother tongue. But although we
accepted so many <i>words</i> from our Norman-French visitors and
immigrants, we accepted from them no <i>habit</i> of speech whatever. We
accepted from them no phrase or idiom: the build and nature of the
English language remained the same&mdash;unaffected by foreign manners
or by foreign habits. It is true that Chaucer has the ridiculous phrase,
“I&nbsp;n’am but dead” (for “I am quite dead”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag4" id = "tag4" href = "#note4">4</a>)&mdash;which is a literal
translation of the well-known French idiom, “Je ne suis que.” But,
though our tongue has always been and is impervious to foreign idiom, it
is probably owing to the great influx of French words which took place
chiefly in the thirteenth century that many people have acquired a habit
of using a long French or Latin word when an English word would do quite
as well&mdash;or, indeed, a&nbsp;great deal better. Thus some people are
found to call a <i>good house</i>, a&nbsp;<i>desirable mansion</i>; and,
instead of the quiet old English proverb, “Buy once, buy twice,” we have
the roundabout Latinisms, “A&nbsp;single commission will ensure a
repetition of orders.” An American writer, speaking of the foreign
ambassadors who had been attacked by Japanese soldiers in Yeddo, says
that “they concluded to occupy a location more salubrious.” This is only
a foreign language, instead of the simple and homely English: “They made
up their minds to settle in a healthier spot.”</p>

<b>Latin of the Third Period</b> (iii). <b>Norman Words</b>
(<i>a</i>).&mdash;The Norman-French words were of several different
kinds. There were words connected with war, with feudalism, and with the
chase. There were new law terms, and words connected with the State, and
the new institutions introduced by the Normans. There were new words
brought in by the Norman churchmen. New titles unknown to the English
were also introduced. A&nbsp;better kind of cooking, a&nbsp;higher and
less homely style of living, was brought into this country by the
Normans; and, along with these, new and unheard-of words.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec25" id = "partIII_chapII_sec25">25.</a>
<b>Norman Words</b> (<i>b</i>).&mdash;The following are some of the
Norman-French terms connected with war: <b>Arms</b>, <b>armour</b>;
<b>assault</b>, <b>battle</b>; <b>captain</b>, <b>chivalry</b>;
<b>joust</b>, <b>lance</b>; <b>standard</b>, <b>trumpet</b>;
<b>mail</b>,<b> vizor</b>. The English word for <b>armour</b> was
<b>harness</b>; but the Normans degraded that word into the armour of a
horse. <b>Battle</b> comes from the Fr. <i>battre</i>, to beat: the
corresponding English word is <b>fight</b>. <b>Captain</b> comes from
the Latin <i>caput</i>, a&nbsp;head. <b>Mail</b> comes from the Latin
<i>macula</i>, the mesh of a net; and the first coats of mail were made
of rings or a kind of metal network. <b>Vizor</b> comes from the Fr.
<i>viser</i>, to look. It was the barred part of the helmet which a man
could see through.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec26" id = "partIII_chapII_sec26">26.</a>
<b>Norman Words</b> (<i>c</i>).&mdash;Feudalism may be described as the
holding of land on condition of giving or providing service in war. Thus
a knight held land of his baron, under promise to serve him so many
days; a&nbsp;baron of his king, on condition that he brought so many men
into the field for such and such a time at the call of his Overlord.
William the Conqueror made the feudal system universal in every part of
England, and compelled every English baron to swear homage to himself
personally. Words relating to feudalism are, among others:
<b>Homage</b>, <b>fealty</b>; <b>esquire</b>, <b>vassal</b>;
<b>herald</b>, <b>scutcheon</b>, and others. <b>Homage</b> is the
declaration of obedience for life of one man to another&mdash;that the
inferior is the <i>man</i> (Fr. <i>homme</i>; L.&nbsp;<i>homo</i>) of
the superior. <b>Fealty</b> is the Norman-French form of the word
<i>fidelity</i>. An <b>esquire</b> is a <b>scutiger</b> (L.), or
<i>shield-bearer</i>; for he carried the shield of the knight, when
<span class = "pagenum">217</span>
<!--png 035-->
they were travelling and no fighting was going on. A&nbsp;<b>vassal</b>
was a “little young man,”&mdash;in Low-Latin <b>vassallus</b>,
a&nbsp;diminutive of <i>vassus</i>, from the Keltic word <i>gwâs</i>,
a&nbsp;man. (The form <i>vassaletus</i> is also found, which gives us
our <i>varlet</i> and <i>valet</i>.) <b>Scutcheon</b> comes from the
Lat. <i>scutum</i>, a&nbsp;shield. Then scutcheon or escutcheon came to
mean <i>coat-of-arms</i>&mdash;or the marks and signs on his shield by
which the name and family of a man were known, when he himself was
covered from head to foot in iron mail.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec27" id = "partIII_chapII_sec27">27.</a>
<b>Norman Words</b> (<i>d</i>).&mdash;The terms connected with the chase
are: <b>Brace</b>, <b>couple</b>; <b>chase</b>, <b>course</b>;
<b>covert</b>, <b>copse</b>, <b>forest</b>; <b>leveret</b>, <b>mews</b>;
<b>quarry</b>, <b>venison</b>. A&nbsp;few remarks about some of these
may be interesting. <b>Brace</b> comes from the Old French <i>brace</i>,
an arm (Mod. French <i>bras</i>); from the Latin <i>brachium</i>. The
root-idea seems to be that which encloses or holds up. Thus
<i>bracing</i> air is that which <i>strings</i> up the nerves and
muscles; and a <i>brace</i> of birds was two birds tied together with a
string.&mdash;The word <b>forest</b> contains in itself a good deal of
unwritten Norman history. It comes from the Latin adverb <i>foras</i>,
out of doors. Hence, in Italy, a&nbsp;stranger or foreigner is still
called a <i>forestiere</i>. A&nbsp;forest in Norman-French was not
necessarily a breadth of land covered with trees; it was simply land
<i>out of</i> the jurisdiction of the common law. Hence, when William
the Conqueror created the New Forest, he merely took the land <i>out
of</i> the rule and charge of the common law, and put it under his own
regal power and personal care. In land of this kind&mdash;much of which
was kept for hunting in&mdash;trees were afterwards planted, partly to
shelter large game, and partly to employ ground otherwise useless in
growing timber.&mdash;<b>Mews</b> is a very odd word. It comes from the
Latin verb <i>mutare</i>, to change. When the falcons employed in
hunting were changing their feathers, or <i>moulting</i> (the word
<i>moult</i> is the same as <i>mews</i> in a different dress), the
French shut them in a cage, which they called <b>mue</b>&mdash;from
<i>mutare</i>. Then the stables for horses were put in the same place;
and hence a row of stables has come to be called a
<b>mews</b>.&mdash;<b>Quarry</b> is quite as strange. The word
<i>quarry</i>, which means a mine of stones,
<span class = "pagenum">218</span>
<!--png 036-->
comes from the Latin <i>quadrāre</i>, to make square. But the hunting
term <i>quarry</i> is of a quite different origin. That comes from the
Latin <i>cor</i> (the heart), which the Old French altered into
<b>quer</b>. When a wild beast was run down and killed, the heart and
entrails were thrown to the dogs as their share of the hunt. Hence
Milton says of the eagle, “He scents his quarry from afar.”&mdash;The
word <b>venison</b> comes to us, through French, from the Lat.
<i>venāri</i>, to hunt; and hence it means <i>hunted flesh</i>. The same
word gives us <i>venery</i>&mdash;the term that was used in the
fourteenth century, by Chaucer among others, for hunting.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec28" id = "partIII_chapII_sec28">28.</a>
<b>Norman Words</b> (<i>e</i>).&mdash;The Normans introduced into
England their own system of law, their own law officers; and hence, into
the English language, came Norman-French law terms. The following are a
few: <b>Assize</b>, <b>attorney</b>; <b>chancellor</b>, <b>court</b>;
<b>judge</b>, <b>justice</b>; <b>plaintiff</b>,<b> sue</b>;
<b>summons</b>, <b>trespass</b>. A&nbsp;few remarks about some of these
may be useful. The <b>chancellor</b> (<i>cancellarius</i>) was the legal
authority who sat behind lattice-work, which was called in Latin
<i>cancelli</i>. This word means, primarily, <i>little crabs</i>; and it
is a diminutive from <i>cancer</i>, a&nbsp;crab. It was so called
because the lattice-work looked like crabs’ claws crossed. Our word
<i>cancel</i> comes from the same root: it means to make cross lines
through anything we wish deleted.&mdash;<b>Court</b> comes from the
Latin <i>cors</i> or <i>cohors</i>, a&nbsp;sheep-pen. It afterwards came
to mean an enclosure, and also a body of Roman soldiers.&mdash;The
proper English word for a <i>judge</i> is <b>deemster</b> or
<b>demster</b> (which appears as the proper name <i>Dempster</i>); and
this is still the name for a judge in the Isle of Man. The French word
comes from two Latin words, <i>dico</i>, I&nbsp;utter, and <i>jus</i>,
right. The word jus is seen in the other French term which we have
received from the Normans&mdash;<b>justice</b>.&mdash;<b>Sue</b> comes
from the Old Fr. <i>suir</i>, which appears in Modern Fr. as
<i>suivre</i>. It is derived from the Lat. word <i>sequor</i>,
I&nbsp;follow (which gives our <i>sequel</i>); and we have compounds of
it in <i>ensue</i>, <i>issue</i>, and <i>pursue</i>.
&mdash;The <b>tres</b> in <b>trespass</b> is a French form of the Latin
trans, beyond or across. <i>Trespass</i>, therefore, means to cross the
bounds of right.</p>

<b>Norman Words</b> (<i>f</i>).&mdash;Some of the church terms
introduced
<span class = "pagenum">219</span>
<!--png 037-->
by the Norman-French are: <b>Altar</b>, <b>Bible</b>; <b>baptism</b>,
<b>ceremony</b>; <b>friar</b>; <b>tonsure</b>; <b>penance</b>,
<b>relic</b>.&mdash;The Normans gave us the words <b>title</b> and
<b>dignity</b> themselves, and also the following titles: <b>Duke</b>,
<b>marquis</b>; <b>count</b>, <b>viscount</b>; <b>peer</b>;
<b>mayor</b>, and others. A&nbsp;duke is a <i>leader</i>; from the Latin
<i>dux</i> (=&nbsp;<i>duc-s</i>). A&nbsp;<b>marquis</b> is a lord who
has to ride the <i>marches</i> or borders between one county, or between
one country, and another. A&nbsp;marquis was also called a
<b>Lord-Marcher</b>. The word <b>count</b> never took root in this
island, because its place was already occupied by the Danish name
<i>earl</i>; but we preserve it in the names <b>countess</b> and
<b>viscount</b>&mdash;the latter of which means a person <i>in the place
of</i> (L.&nbsp;<i>vice</i>) a count. <b>Peer</b> comes from the Latin
<i>par</i>, an equal. The House of Peers is the House of
Lords&mdash;that is, of those who are, at least when in the House,
<i>equal</i> in rank and <i>equal</i> in power of voting. It is a
fundamental doctrine in English law that every man “is to be tried by
his <i>peers</i>.”&mdash;It is worthy of note that, in general, the
<b>French</b> names for different kinds of food designated the
<b>cooked</b> meats; while the names for the <b>living</b> animals that
furnish them are <b>English</b>. Thus we have <i>beef</i> and <i>ox</i>;
<i>mutton</i> and <i>sheep</i>; <i>veal</i> and <i>calf</i>; <i>pork</i>
and <i>pig</i>. There is a remarkable passage in Sir Walter Scott’s
‘Ivanhoe,’ which illustrates this fact with great force and
picturesqueness:&mdash;</p>

<b>General Character of the Norman-French Contributions.</b>&mdash;The
Norman-French contributions to our language gave us a number of
<b>general names</b> or <b>class-names</b>; while the names for
<b>individual</b> things are, in general, of purely English origin. The
words <b>animal</b> and <b>beast</b>, for example, are French
(or&nbsp;Latin); but the words <b>fox</b>, <b>hound</b>, <b>whale</b>,
<b>snake</b>, <b>wasp</b>, and <b>fly</b> are purely English.&mdash;The
words <b>family</b>, <b>relation</b>, <b>parent</b>, <b>ancestor</b>,
are French; but the names <b>father</b>, <b>mother</b>, <b>son</b>,
<b>daughter</b>, <b>gossip</b>, are English.&mdash;The words
<b>title</b> and <b>dignity</b> are French; but the words <b>king</b>
and <b>queen</b>, <b>lord</b> and <b>lady</b>, <b>knight</b> and
<b>sheriff</b>, are English.&mdash;Perhaps the most remarkable instance
of this is to be found in the abstract terms employed for the offices
and functions of State. Of these, the English language possesses only
one&mdash;the word <b>kingdom</b>. Norman-French, on the other hand, has
given us the words <b>realm</b>, <b>court</b>, <b>state</b>,
<b>constitution</b>, <b>people</b>, <b>treaty</b>, <b>audience</b>,
<b>navy</b>, <b>army</b>, and others&mdash;amounting in all to nearly
forty. When, however, we come to terms denoting labour and
work&mdash;such as agriculture
<span class = "pagenum">221</span>
<!--png 039-->
and seafaring, we find the proportions entirely reversed. The English
language, in such cases, contributes almost everything; the French
nearly nothing. In agriculture, while <b>plough</b>, <b>rake</b>,
<b>harrow</b>, <b>flail</b>, and many others are English words, not a
single term for an agricultural process or implement has been given us
by the warlike Norman-French.&mdash;While the words <b>ship</b> and
<b>boat</b>; <b>hull</b> and <b>fleet</b>; <b>oar</b> and <b>sail</b>,
are all English, the Normans have presented us with only the single word
<b>prow</b>. It is as if all the Norman conqueror had to do was to take
his stand at the prow, gazing upon the land he was going to seize, while
the Low-German sailors worked for him at oar and sail.&mdash;Again,
while the names of the various parts of the body&mdash;<b>eye</b>,
<b>nose</b>, <b>cheek</b>, <b>tongue</b>, <b>hand</b>, <b>foot</b>, and
more than eighty others&mdash;are all English, we have received only
about ten similar words from the French&mdash;such as <b>spirit</b> and
<b>corpse</b>; <b>perspiration</b>; <b>face</b> and <b>stature</b>.
Speaking broadly, we may say that all words that express <b>general
notions</b>, or generalisations, are French or Latin; while words that
express <b>specific</b> actions or concrete existences are pure English.
Mr&nbsp;Spalding observes&mdash;“We use a foreign term naturalised when
we speak of ‘colour’ universally; but we fall back on our home stores if
we have to tell what the colour is, calling it ‘red’ or ‘yellow,’
‘white’ or ‘black,’ ‘green’ or ‘brown.’ We are Romans when we speak in a
<i>general</i> way of ‘moving’; but we are Teutons if we ‘leap’ or
‘spring,’ if we ‘slip,’ ‘slide,’ or ‘fall,’ if we ‘walk,’ ‘run,’ ‘swim,’
or ‘ride,’ if we ‘creep’ or ‘crawl’ or ‘fly.’”</p>

<b>Gains to English from Norman-French.</b>&mdash;The gains from the
Norman-French contribution are large, and are also of very great
importance. Mr&nbsp;Lowell says, that the Norman element came in as
quickening leaven to the rather heavy and lumpy Saxon dough. It stirred
the whole mass, gave new life to the language, a&nbsp;much higher and
wider scope to the thoughts, much greater power and copiousness to the
expression of our thoughts, and a finer and brighter rhythm to our
English sentences. “To Chaucer,” he says, in ‘My Study Windows,’ “French
must have been almost as truly a mother tongue as English. In him we see
the first result of the Norman yeast
<span class = "pagenum">222</span>
<!--png 040-->
upon the home-baked Saxon loaf. The flour had been honest, the paste
well kneaded, but the inspiring leaven was wanting till the Norman
brought it over. Chaucer works still in the solid material of his race,
but with what airy lightness has he not infused it? Without ceasing to
be English, he has escaped from being insular.” Let us look at some of
these gains a little more in detail.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec32" id = "partIII_chapII_sec32">32.</a>
<b>Norman-French Synonyms.</b>&mdash;We must not consider a
<b>synonym</b> as a word that means exactly <i>the same thing</i> as the
word of which it is a synonym; because then there would be neither room
nor use for such a word in the language. A&nbsp;synonym is a word of the
same meaning as another, but with a slightly different shade of
meaning,&mdash;or it is used under different circumstances and in a
different connection, or it puts the same idea under a new angle.
<b>Begin</b> and <b>commence</b>, <b>will</b> and <b>testament</b>, are
exact equivalents&mdash;are complete synonyms; but there are very few
more of this kind in our language. The moment the genius of a language
gets hold of two words of the same meaning, it sets them to do different
kinds of work,&mdash;to express different parts or shades of that
meaning. Thus <b>limb</b> and <b>member</b>, <b>luck</b> and
<b>fortune</b>, have the same meaning; but we cannot speak of a
<i>limb</i> of the Royal Society, or of the <i>luck</i> of the
Rothschilds, who made their <i>fortune</i> by hard work and steady
attention to business. We have, by the aid of the Norman-French
contributions, <b>flower</b> as well as <b>bloom</b>; <b>branch</b> and
<b>bough</b>; <b>purchase</b> and <b>buy</b>; <b>amiable</b> and
<b>friendly</b>; <b>cordial</b> and <b>hearty</b>; <b>country</b> and
<b>land</b>; <b>gentle</b> and <b>mild</b>; <b>desire</b> and
<b>wish</b>; <b>labour</b> and <b>work</b>; <b>miserable</b> and
<b>wretched</b>. These pairs of words enable poets and other writers to
use the right word in the right place. And we, preferring our Saxon or
good old English words to any French or Latin importations, prefer to
speak of <b>a hearty welcome</b> instead of <b>a cordial reception</b>;
of <b>a loving wife</b> instead of an <b>amiable consort</b>; of <b>a
wretched man</b> instead of <b>a miserable individual</b>.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec33" id = "partIII_chapII_sec33">33.</a>
<b>Bilingualism.</b>&mdash;How did these Norman-French words find their
way into the language? What was the road by which
<span class = "pagenum">223</span>
<!--png 041-->
they came? What was the process that enabled them to find a place in and
to strike deep root into our English soil? Did the learned men&mdash;the
monks and the clergy&mdash;make a selection of words, write them in
their books, and teach them to the English people? Nothing of the sort.
The process was a much ruder one&mdash;but at the same time one much
more practical, more effectual, and more lasting in its results. The two
peoples&mdash;the Normans and the English&mdash;found that they had to
live together. They met at church, in the market-place, in the drilling
field, at the archery butts, in the courtyards of castles; and, on the
battle-fields of France, the Saxon bowman showed that he could fight as
well, as bravely, and even to better purpose than his lord&mdash;the
Norman baron. At all these places, under all these circumstances, the
Norman and the Englishman were obliged to speak with each other. Now
arose a striking phenomenon. Every man, as Professor Earle puts it,
turned himself as it were into a walking phrase-book or dictionary. When
a Norman had to use a French word, he tried to put the English word for
it alongside of the French word; when an Englishman used an English
word, he joined with it the French equivalent. Then the language soon
began to swarm with “yokes of words”; our words went in couples; and the
habit then begun has continued down even to the present day. And thus it
is that we possess such couples as <b>will and testament</b>; <b>act and
deed</b>; <b>use and wont</b>; <b>aid and abet</b>. Chaucer’s poems are
full of these pairs. He joins together <b>hunting and venery</b> (though
both words mean exactly the same thing); <b>nature and kind</b>;
<b>cheere and face</b>; <b>pray and beseech</b>; <b>mirth and
jollity</b>. Later on, the Prayer-Book, which was written in the years
1540 to 1559, keeps up the habit: and we find the pairs <b>acknowledge
and confess</b>; <b>assemble and meet together</b>; <b>dissemble and
cloak</b>; <b>humble and lowly</b>. To the more English part of the
congregation the simple Saxon words would come home with kindly
association; to others, the words <i>confess</i>, <i>assemble</i>,
<i>dissemble</i>, and <i>humble</i> would speak with greater force and
clearness.&mdash;Such is the phenomenon called by Professor Earle
<b>bilingualism</b>. “It is, in fact,” he says, “a&nbsp;putting of
colloquial formulæ
<span class = "pagenum">224</span>
<!--png 042-->
to do the duty of a French-English and English-French vocabulary.” Even
Hooker, who wrote at the end of the sixteenth century, seems to have
been obliged to use these pairs; and we find in his writings the couples
“cecity and blindness,” “nocive and hurtful,” “sense and meaning.”</p>

<b>Losses of English from the Incoming of
Norman-French.</b>&mdash;(i)&nbsp;Before the coming of the Normans, the
English language was in the habit of forming compounds with ease and
effect. But, after the introduction of the Norman-French language, that
power seems gradually to have disappeared; and ready-made French or
Latin words usurped the place of the home-grown English compound. Thus
<b>despair</b> pushed out <b>wanhope</b>; <b>suspicion</b> dethroned
<b>wantrust</b>; <b>bidding-sale</b> was expelled by <b>auction</b>;
<b>learning-knight</b> by <b>disciple</b>; <b>rime-craft</b> by the
Greek word <b>arithmetic</b>; <b>gold-hoard</b> by <b>treasure</b>;
<b>book-hoard</b> by <b>library</b>; <b>earth-tilth</b> by
<b>agriculture</b>; <b>wonstead</b> by <b>residence</b>; and so with a
large number of others.&mdash;Many English words, moreover, had their
meanings depreciated and almost degraded; and the words themselves lost
their ancient rank and dignity. Thus the Norman conquerors put their
foot&mdash;literally and metaphorically&mdash;on the Saxon
<b>chair</b>,<a class = "tag" name = "tag5" id = "tag5" href =
"#note5">5</a> which thus became a <b>stool</b>, or a <b>footstool</b>.
<b>Thatch</b>, which is a doublet of the word <b>deck</b>, was the name
for any kind of roof; but the coming of the Norman-French lowered it to
indicate a <i>roof of straw</i>. <b>Whine</b> was used for the weeping
or crying of human beings; but it is now restricted to the cry of a dog.
<b>Hide</b> was the generic term for the skin of any animal; it is now
limited in modern English to the skin of a beast.&mdash;The most
damaging result upon our language was that it entirely <b>stopped the
growth of English words</b>. We could, for example, make out of the word
<b>burn</b>&mdash;the derivatives <b>brunt</b>, <b>brand</b>,
<b>brandy</b>, <b>brown</b>, <b>brimstone</b>, and others; but this
power died out with the coming in of the Norman-French language. After
that, instead of growing our own words, we
<span class = "pagenum">225</span>
<!--png 043-->
adopted them ready-made.&mdash;Professor Craik compares the English and
Latin languages to two banks; and says that, when the Normans came over,
the account at the English bank was closed, and we drew only upon the
Latin bank. But the case is worse than this. English lost its power of
growth and expansion from the centre; from this time, it could only add
to its bulk by borrowing and conveying from without&mdash;by the
external accretion of foreign words.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec35" id = "partIII_chapII_sec35">35.</a>
<b>Losses of English from the Incoming of
Norman-French.</b>&mdash;(ii)&nbsp;The arrestment of growth in the
purely English part of our language, owing to the irruption of
Norman-French, and also to the ease with which we could take a
ready-made word from Latin or from Greek, killed off an old power which
we once possessed, and which was not without its own use and
expressiveness. This was the power of making compound words. The Greeks
in ancient times had, and the Germans in modern times have, this power
in a high degree. Thus a Greek comic poet has a word of fourteen
syllables, which may be thus translated&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quotation">
“Meanly-rising-early-and-hurrying-to-the-tribunal-to-denounce-another-for-an-infraction-of-the-law-concerning-the-exportation-of-figs.”<a
class = "tag" name = "tag6" id = "tag6" href = "#note6">6</a></p>

<p>And the Germans have a compound like “the-all-to-nothing-crushing
philosopher.” The Germans also say <i>iron-path</i> for <i>railway</i>,
<i>handshoe</i> for <i>glove</i>, and <i>finger-hat</i> for
<i>thimble</i>. We also possessed this power at one time, and employed
it both in proper and in common names. Thus we had and have the names
<i>Brakespear</i>, <i>Shakestaff</i>, <i>Shakespear</i>,
<i>Golightly</i>, <i>Dolittle</i>, <i>Standfast</i>; and the common
nouns <i>want-wit</i>, <i>find-fault</i>, <i>mumble-news</i> (for
<i>tale-bearer</i>), <i>pinch-penny</i> (for <i>miser</i>),
<i>slugabed</i>. In older times we had <i>three-foot-stool</i>,
<i>three-man-beetle</i><a class = "tag" name = "tag7" id = "tag7" href =
"#note7">7</a>; <i>stone-cold</i>, <i>heaven-bright</i>,
<i>honey-sweet</i>, <i>snail-slow</i>, <i>nut-brown</i>,
<i>lily-livered</i> (for <i>cowardly</i>); <i>brand-fire-new</i>;
<i>earth-wandering</i>, <i>wind-dried</i>, <i>thunder-blasted</i>,
<i>death-doomed</i>, and many others. But such words as <i>forbears</i>
or <i>fore-elders</i> have been pushed out by <i>ancestors</i>;
<span class = "pagenum">226</span>
<!--png 044-->
<i>forewit</i> by <i>caution</i> or <i>prudence</i>; and <i>inwit</i> by
<i>conscience</i>. Mr&nbsp;Barnes, the Dorsetshire poet, would like to
see these and similar compounds restored, and thinks that we might well
return to the old clear well-springs of “English undefiled,” and make
our own compounds out of our own words. He even carries his desires into
the region of English grammar, and, for <i>degrees of comparison</i>,
proposes the phrase <i>pitches of suchness</i>. Thus, instead of the
Latin word <i>omnibus</i>, he would have <i>folk-wain</i>; for the Greek
<i>botany</i>, he would substitute <i>wort-lore</i>; for <i>auction</i>,
he would give us <i>bode-sale</i>; <i>globule</i> he would replace with
<i>ballkin</i>; the Greek word <i>horizon</i> must give way to the pure
English <i>sky-edge</i>; and, instead of <i>quadrangle</i>, he would
have us all write and say <i>four-winkle</i>.</p>

<b>Losses of English from the Incoming of
Norman-French.</b>&mdash;(iii)&nbsp;When once a way was made for the
entrance of French words into our English language, the immigrations
were rapid and numerous. Hence there were many changes both in the
grammar and in the vocabulary of English from the year 1100, the year in
which we may suppose those Englishmen who were living at the date of the
battle of Hastings had died out. These changes were more or less rapid,
according to circumstances. But perhaps the most rapid and remarkable
change took place in the lifetime of William Caxton, the great printer,
who was born in 1410. In his preface to his translation of the ‘Æneid’
of Virgil, which he published in 1490, when he was eighty years of age,
he says that he cannot understand old books that were written when he
was a boy&mdash;that “the olde Englysshe is more lyke to dutche than
englysshe,” and that “our langage now vsed varyeth ferre from that
whiche was vsed and spoken when I was borne. For we Englysshemen ben
borne ynder the domynacyon of the mone [moon], which is neuer stedfaste,
but euer wauerynge, wexynge one season, and waneth and dycreaseth
another season.” This as regards time.&mdash;But he has the same
complaint to make as regards place. “Comyn englysshe that is spoken in
one shyre varyeth from another.” And he tells an odd story in
illustration of this fact. He tells about certain merchants who were in
a ship “in Tamyse” (on&nbsp;the
<span class = "pagenum">227</span>
<!--png 045-->
Thames), who were bound for Zealand, but were wind-stayed at the
Foreland, and took it into their heads to go on shore there. One of the
merchants, whose name was Sheffelde, a&nbsp;mercer, entered a house,
“and axed for mete, and specyally he axyd after eggys.” But the
“goode-wyf” replied that she “coude speke no frenshe.” The merchant, who
was a steady Englishman, lost his temper, “for he also coude speke no
frenshe, but wolde have hadde eggys; and she understode hym not.”
Fortunately, a&nbsp;friend happened to join him in the house, and he
acted as interpreter. The friend said that “he wolde have eyren; then
the goode wyf sayde that she understod hym wel.” And then the
simple-minded but much-perplexed Caxton goes on to say: “Loo! what
sholde a man in thyse dayes now wryte, eggës or eyren?” Such were the
difficulties that beset printers and writers in the close of the
fifteenth century.</p>

<b>Latin of the Fourth Period.</b>&mdash;(i)&nbsp;This contribution
differs very essentially in character from the last. The Norman-French
contribution was a gift from a people to a people&mdash;from living
beings to living beings; this new contribution was rather a conveyance
of words from books to books, and it never influenced&mdash;in any great
degree&mdash;the <b>spoken language</b> of the English people. The ear
and the mouth carried the Norman-French words into our language; the
eye, the pen, and the printing-press were the instruments that brought
in the Latin words of the Fourth Period. The Norman-French words that
came in took and kept their place in the spoken language of the masses
of the people; the Latin words that we received in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries kept their place in the written or printed
language of books, of scholars, and of literary men. These new Latin
words came in with the <b>Revival of Learning</b>, which is also called
the <b>Renascence</b>.</p>

<p>The Turks attacked and took Constantinople in the year <b>1453</b>;
and the great Greek and Latin scholars who lived in that city hurriedly
packed up their priceless manuscripts and books, and fled to all parts
of Italy, Germany, France, and even into England. The loss of the East
became the gain of the West. These scholars became teachers; they taught
the Greek
<span class = "pagenum">228</span>
<!--png 046-->
and Roman classics to eager and earnest learners; and thus a new impulse
was given to the study of the great masterpieces of human thought and
literary style. And so it came to pass in course of time that every one
who wished to become an educated man studied the literature of Greece
and Rome. Even women took to the study. Lady Jane Grey was a good Greek
and Latin scholar; and so was Queen Elizabeth. From this time began an
enormous importation of Latin words into our language. Being imported by
the eye and the pen, they suffered little or no change; the spirit of
the people did not influence them in the least&mdash;neither the organs
of speech nor the ear affected either the pronunciation or the spelling
of them. If we look down the columns of any English dictionary, we shall
find these later Latin words in hundreds. <i>Opinionem</i> became
<b>opinion</b>; <i>factionem</i>, <b>faction</b>; <i>orationem</i>,
<b>oration</b>; <i>pungentem</i> passed over in the form of
<b>pungent</b> (though we had <i>poignant</i> already from the French);
<i>pauperem</i> came in as <b>pauper</b>; and <i>separatum</i> became
<b>separate</b>.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec38" id = "partIII_chapII_sec38">38.</a>
<b>Latin of the Fourth Period.</b>&mdash;(ii)&nbsp;This went on to such
an extent in the sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth century,
that one writer says of those who spoke and wrote this Latinised
English, “If some of their mothers were alive, they were not able to
tell what they say.” And Sir Thomas Browne (1605-1682) remarks: “If
elegancy (=&nbsp;the use of Latin words) still proceedeth, and English
pens maintain that stream we have of late observed to flow from many, we
shall, within a few years, be fain to learn Latin to understand English,
and a work will prove of equal facility in either.” Mr&nbsp;Alexander
Gill, an eminent schoolmaster, and the then head-master of
St&nbsp;Paul’s School, where, among his other pupils, he taught John
Milton, wrote a book in 1619 on the English language; and, among other
remarks, he says: “O&nbsp;harsh lips! I&nbsp;now hear all around me such
words as <i>common</i>, <i>vices</i>, <i>envy</i>, <i>malice</i>; even
<i>virtue</i>, <i>study</i>, <i>justice</i>, <i>pity</i>, <i>mercy</i>,
<i>compassion</i>, <i>profit</i>, <i>commodity</i>, <i>colour</i>,
<i>grace</i>, <i>favour</i>, <i>acceptance</i>. But whither,
I&nbsp;pray, in all the world, have you banished those words which our
forefathers used for these new-fangled ones?
<span class = "pagenum">229</span>
<!--png 047-->
Are our words to be executed like our citizens?” And he calls this
fashion of using Latin words “the new mange in our speaking and
writing.” But the fashion went on growing; and even uneducated people
thought it a clever thing to use a Latin instead of a good English word.
Samuel Rowlands, a&nbsp;writer in the seventeenth century, ridicules
this affectation in a few lines of verse. He pretends that he was out
walking on the highroad, and met a countryman who wanted to know what
o’clock it was, and whether he was on the right way to the town or
village he was making for. The writer saw at once that he was a simple
bumpkin; and, when he heard that he had lost his way, he turned up his
nose at the poor fellow, and ordered him to be off at once. Here are the
lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">

<b>Latin of the Fourth Period.</b>&mdash;(iii)&nbsp;What happened in the
case of the Norman-French contribution, happened also in this. The
language became saturated with these new Latin words, until it became
satiated, then, as it were, disgusted, and would take no more.
Hundreds&nbsp;of</p>

“Long-tailed words in <i>osity</i> and <i>ation</i>”</p>

<p>crowded into the English language; but many of them were doomed to
speedy expulsion. Thus words like <i>discerptibility</i>,
<i>supervacaneousness</i>, <i>septentrionality</i>, <i>ludibundness</i>
(love of sport), came in in crowds. The verb <i>intenerate</i> tried to
turn out <i>soften</i>; and <i>deturpate</i> to take the place of
<i>defile</i>. But good writers, like Bacon and Raleigh, took care to
avoid the use of such terms, and to employ only those Latin words which
gave them the power to indicate a new idea&mdash;a&nbsp;new meaning or a
new shade
<span class = "pagenum">230</span>
<!--png 048-->
of meaning. And when we come to the eighteenth century, we find that a
writer like Addison would have shuddered at the very mention of such
“inkhorn terms.”</p>

<b>Eye-Latin and Ear-Latin.</b>&mdash;(i)&nbsp;One slight influence
produced by this spread of devotion to classical Latin&mdash;to the
Latin of Cicero and Livy, of Horace and Virgil&mdash;was to alter the
spelling of French words. We had already received&mdash;through the
ear&mdash;the French words <i>assaute</i>, <i>aventure</i>,
<i>defaut</i>, <i>dette</i>, <i>vitaille</i>, and others. But when our
scholars became accustomed to the book-form of these words in Latin
books, they gradually altered them&mdash;for the eye and ear&mdash;into
<i>assault</i>, <i>adventure</i>, <i>default</i>, <i>debt</i>, and
<i>victuals</i>. They went further. A&nbsp;large number of Latin words
that already existed in the language in their Norman-French form (for we
must not forget that French is Latin “with the ends bitten
off”&mdash;changed by being spoken peculiarly and heard imperfectly)
were reintroduced in their original Latin form. Thus we had
<b>caitiff</b> from the Normans; but we reintroduced it in the shape of
<b>captive</b>, which comes almost unaltered from the Latin
<i>captivum</i>. <b>Feat</b> we had from the Normans; but the Latin
<i>factum</i>, which provided the word, presented us with a second form
of it in the word <b>fact</b>. Such words might be called
<b>Ear-Latin</b> and <b>Eye-Latin</b>; <b>Mouth-Latin</b> and
<b>Book-Latin</b>; <b>Spoken Latin</b> and <b>Written Latin</b>; or
Latin at second-hand and Latin at first-hand.</p>

<b>Eye-Latin and Ear-Latin.</b>&mdash;(ii)&nbsp;This coming in of the
same word by two different doors&mdash;by the Eye and by the
Ear&mdash;has given rise to the phenomenon of <b>Doublets</b>. The
following is a list of <b>Latin Doublets</b>; and it will be noticed
that Latin<sup>1</sup> stands for Latin at first-hand&mdash;from books;
and Latin<sup>2</sup> for Latin at second-hand&mdash;through the
Norman-French.</p>

<b>Remarks on the above Table.</b>&mdash;The word <b>benison</b>,
a&nbsp;blessing, may be contrasted with its opposite, <b>malison</b>,
a&nbsp;curse.&mdash;<b>Cadence</b> is the falling of sounds;
<b>chance</b> the befalling of events.&mdash;A&nbsp;<b>caitiff</b> was
at first a <i>captive</i>&mdash;then a person who made no proper
defence, but <i>allowed</i> himself to be taken
captive.&mdash;A&nbsp;<b>corps</b> is a <i>body</i> of troops.&mdash;The
word <b>sample</b> is found, in older English, in the form of
<b>ensample</b>.&mdash;A&nbsp;<b>feat</b> of arms is a deed or
<b>fact</b> of arms, <i>par excellence</i>.&mdash;To understand how
<b>fragile</b> became <b>frail</b>, we must pronounce the <b>g</b> hard,
and notice how the hard guttural falls easily away&mdash;as in our own
native words <i>flail</i> and <i>hail</i>, which formerly contained a
hard <b>g</b>.&mdash;A&nbsp;<b>major</b> is a <i>greater</i> captain;
a&nbsp;<b>mayor</b> is a greater
<i>magistrate</i>.&mdash;A&nbsp;<b>magister</b> means a <i>bigger
man</i>&mdash;as opposed to a <b>minister</b> (from <i>minus</i>),
a&nbsp;smaller man.&mdash;<b>Moneta</b> was the name given to a stamped
coin, because these coins were first struck in the temple of Juno
Moneta, Juno the Adviser or the Warner. (From the same
root&mdash;<b>mon</b>&mdash;come <i>monition</i>, <i>admonition</i>;
<i>monitor</i>; <i>admonish</i>.)&mdash;Shakespeare uses the word
<b>orison</b> freely for <i>prayer</i>, as in the address of Hamlet to
Ophelia, where he says, “Nymph, in thy orisons, be all my sins
remembered!”&mdash;<b>Poor</b> comes to us from an Old French word
<i>poure</i>; the newer French is <i>pauvre</i>.&mdash;To understand the
vanishing of the <b>g</b> sound in <i>poignant</i>, we must remember
that the Romans sounded it always hard.&mdash;<b>Sever</b> we get
through <i>separate</i>, because <b>p</b> and <b>v</b> are both labials,
and therefore easily interchangeable.&mdash;<b>Treason</b>&mdash;with
its <b>s</b> instead of <b>ti</b>&mdash;may be compared with
<b>benison</b>, <b>malison</b>, <b>orison</b>, <b>poison</b>, and
<b>reason</b>.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec43" id = "partIII_chapII_sec43">43.</a>
<b>Conclusions from the above Table.</b>&mdash;If we examine the table
on page 231 with care, we shall come to several undeniable conclusions.
(i)&nbsp;First, the words which come to us direct from Latin are found
more in books than in everyday speech. (ii)&nbsp;Secondly, they are
longer. The reason is that the words that have come through French have
been worn down by the careless pronunciation of many
generations&mdash;by that desire for ease in the pronouncing of words
which characterises all languages, and have at last been compelled to
take that form which was least difficult to pronounce.
(iii)&nbsp;Thirdly, the two
<span class = "pagenum">233</span>
<!--png 051-->
sets of words have, in each case, either (<i>a</i>)&nbsp;very different
meanings, or (<i>b</i>)&nbsp;different shades of meaning. There is no
likeness of meaning in <i>cadence</i> and <i>chance</i>, except the
common meaning of <i>fall</i> which belongs to the root from which they
both spring. And the different shades of meaning between <b>history</b>
and <b>story</b>, between <b>regal</b> and <b>royal</b>, between
<b>persecute</b> and <b>pursue</b>, are also quite plainly marked, and
are of the greatest use in composition.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec44" id = "partIII_chapII_sec44">44.</a>
<b>Latin Triplets.</b>&mdash;Still more remarkable is the fact that
there are in our language words that have made three
appearances&mdash;one through Latin, one through Norman-French, and one
through ordinary French. These seem to live quietly side by side in the
language; and no one asks by what claim they are here. They are useful:
that is enough. These triplets are&mdash;<b>regal</b>, <b>royal</b>, and
<b>real</b>; <b>legal</b>, <b>loyal</b>, and <b>leal</b>;
<b>fidelity</b>, <b>faithfulness</b>,<a class = "tag" name = "tag8" id =
"tag8" href = "#note8">8</a> and <b>fealty</b>. The adjective real we no
longer possess in the sense of <i>royal</i>, but Chaucer uses it; and it
still exists in the noun <b>real-m</b>. <b>Leal</b> is most used in
Scotland, where it has a settled abode in the well-known phrase “the
land o’ the leal.”</p>

<b>Greek Doublets.</b>&mdash;The same double introduction, which we
noticed in the case of Latin words, takes place in regard to Greek
words. It seems to have been forgotten that our English forms of them
had been already given us by St&nbsp;Augustine and the Church, and a
newer form of each was reintroduced. The following are a few
examples:&mdash;</p>

<p>It may be remarked of the word <i>fancy</i>, that, in Shakespeare’s
time, it meant <i>love</i> or <i>imagination</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“Tell me, where is <i>fancy</i> bred,</p>
<p>Or in the heart, or in the head?”</p>
</div>

<p>It is now restricted to mean a lighter and less serious kind of
imagination. Thus we say that Milton’s ‘Paradise Lost’ is a work of
imagination; but that Moore’s ‘Lalla Rookh’ is a product of the poet’s
fancy.</p>

<b>Characteristics of the Two Elements of English.</b>&mdash;If we keep
our attention fixed on the two chief elements in our language&mdash;the
English element and the Latin element&mdash;the Teutonic and the
Romance&mdash;we shall find some striking qualities manifest themselves.
We have already said that whole sentences can be made containing only
English words, while it is impossible to do this with Latin or other
foreign words. Let us take two passages&mdash;one from a daily
newspaper, and the other from Shakespeare:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quotation">
(i)&nbsp;“We find the <i>functions</i> of such an <i>official
defined</i> in the <i>Act</i>. He is to be a <i>legally qualified
medical practitioner</i> of skill and <i>experience</i>, to
<i>inspect</i> and <i>report periodically</i> on the <i>sanitary
condition</i> of town or <i>district</i>; to <i>ascertain</i> the
<i>existence</i> of <i>diseases</i>, more <i>especially epidemics
increasing</i> the <i>rates</i> of <i>mortality</i>, and to <i>point</i>
out the <i>existence</i> of any <i>nuisances</i> or other <i>local
causes</i>, which are likely to <i>originate</i> and <i>maintain</i>
such <i>diseases</i>, and <i>injuriously affect</i> the health of the
<i>inhabitants</i> of such town or <i>district</i>; to take
<i>cognisance</i> of the <i>existence</i> of any <i>contagious
disease</i>, and to point out the most <i>efficacious means</i> for the
<i>ventilation</i> of <i>chapels</i>, <i>schools</i>, <i>registered
lodging</i>-houses, and other <i>public</i> buildings.”
</p>

<p>In this passage, all the words in italics are either Latin or Greek.
But, if the purely English words were left out, the sentence would fall
into ruins&mdash;would become a mere rubbish-heap of words. It is the
small particles that give life and
<span class = "pagenum">235</span>
<!--png 053-->
motion to each sentence. They are the joints and hinges on which the
whole sentence moves.&mdash;Let us now look at a passage from
Shakespeare. It is from the speech of Macbeth, after he has made up his
mind to murder Duncan:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>(ii) “Go bid thy <i>mistress</i>, when my drink is ready,</p>
<p class = "three">
She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed!&mdash;</p>
<p class = "three">
Is this a dagger which I see before me,</p>
<p class = "three">
The handle toward my hand? Come! let me clutch thee!</p>
<p class = "three">
&mdash;I have thee not; and yet I see thee still.”</p>
</div>

<p>In this passage there is only one Latin (or French) word&mdash;the
word <i>mistress</i>. If Shakespeare had used the word <b>lady</b>, the
passage would have been entirely English.&mdash;The passage from the
newspaper deals with large <b>generalisations</b>; that from Shakespeare
with individual <b>acts</b> and <b>feelings</b>&mdash;with things that
come <b>home</b> “to the business and bosom” of man as man. Every master
of the English language understands well the art of mingling the two
elements&mdash;so as to obtain a fine effect; and none better than
writers like Shakespeare, Milton, Gray, and Tennyson. Shakespeare makes
Antony say of Cleopatra:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“Age cannot wither her; nor <i>custom</i> stale</p>
<p>Her infinite <i>variety</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Here the French (or Latin) words <i>custom</i> and <i>variety</i>
form a vivid contrast to the English verb <i>stale</i>, throw up its
meaning and colour, and give it greater prominence.&mdash;Milton makes
Eve say:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p class = "halfline">
“I thither went</p>
<p>With <i>inexperienc’d</i> thought, and laid me down</p>
<p>On the green bank, to look into the <i>clear</i></p>
<p>Smooth <i>lake</i>, that to me seem’d another sky.”</p>
</div>

<p>Here the words <i>inexperienced</i> and <i>clear</i> give variety to
the sameness of the English words.&mdash;Gray, in the Elegy, has this
verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“The breezy call of <i>incense</i>-breathing morn,</p>
<p class = "two">
The swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,</p>
<p>The cock’s shrill <i>clarion</i> or the <i>echoing</i> horn,</p>
<p class = "two">
No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class = "pagenum">236</span>
<!--png 054-->
Here <i>incense</i>, <i>clarion</i>, and <i>echoing</i> give a vivid
colouring to the plainer hues of the homely English
phrases.&mdash;Tennyson, in the Lotos-Eaters, vi., writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“Dear is the <i>memory</i> of our wedded lives,</p>
<p>And dear the last <i>embraces</i> of our wives</p>
<p>And their warm tears: but all hath <i>suffer’d change</i>;</p>
<p>For <i>surely</i> now our household hearths are cold:</p>
<p>Our sons <i>inherit</i> us: our looks are <i>strange</i>:</p>
<p>And we should come like ghosts to <i>trouble joy</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Most powerful is the introduction of the French words <i>suffered
change</i>, <i>inherit</i>, <i>strange</i>, and <i>trouble joy</i>; for
they give with painful force the contrast of the present state of
desolation with the homely rest and happiness of the old abode, the love
of the loving wives, the faithfulness of the stalwart sons.</p>

<b>English and other Doublets.</b>&mdash;We have already seen how, by
the presentation of the same word at two different doors&mdash;the door
of Latin and the door of French&mdash;we are in possession of a
considerable number of doublets. But this phenomenon is not limited to
Latin and French&mdash;is not solely due to the contributions we receive
from these languages. We find it also <b>within</b> English itself; and
causes of the most different description bring about the same results.
For various reasons, the English language is very rich in doublets. It
possesses nearly five hundred pairs of such words. The language is all
the richer for having them, as it is thereby enabled to give fuller and
clearer expression to the different shades and delicate varieties of
meaning in the mind.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec48" id = "partIII_chapII_sec48">48.</a>
<b>The sources of doublets</b> are various. But five different causes
seem chiefly to have operated in producing them. They are due to
differences of <b>pronunciation</b>; to differences in <b>spelling</b>;
to <b>contractions</b> for convenience in daily speech; to differences
in <b>dialects</b>; and to the fact that many of them come from
<b>different languages</b>. Let us look at a few examples of each. At
bottom, however, all these differences will be found to resolve
themselves into <b>differences of pronunciation</b>. They are either
differences in the pronunciation of the same word by
<span class = "pagenum">237</span>
<!--png 055-->
different tribes, or by men in different counties, who speak different
dialects; or by men of different nations.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec49" id = "partIII_chapII_sec49">49.</a>
<b>Differences in Pronunciation.</b>&mdash;From this source we have
<b>parson</b> and <b>person</b> (the parson being the <i>person</i> or
representative of the Church); <b>sop</b> and <b>soup</b>; <b>task</b>
and <b>tax</b> (the <b>sk</b> has here become <b>ks</b>); <b>thread</b>
and <b>thrid</b>; <b>ticket</b> and <b>etiquette</b>; <b>sauce</b> and
<b>souse</b> (to&nbsp;steep in brine); <b>squall</b> and
<b>squeal</b>.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec50" id = "partIII_chapII_sec50">50.</a>
<b>Differences in Spelling.</b>&mdash;<b>To</b> and <b>too</b> are the
same word&mdash;one being used as a preposition, the other as an adverb;
<b>of</b> and <b>off</b>, <b>from</b> and <b>fro</b>, are only different
spellings, which represent different functions or uses of the same word;
<b>onion</b> and <b>union</b> are the same word. An <b>union</b><a class
= "tag" name = "tag10" id = "tag10" href = "#note10">10</a> comes from
the Latin <b>unus</b>, one, and it meant a large single
pearl&mdash;a&nbsp;unique jewel; the word was then applied to the plant,
the head of which is of a pearl-shape.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec51" id = "partIII_chapII_sec51">51.</a>
<b>Contractions.</b>&mdash;Contraction has been a pretty fruitful source
of doublets in English. A&nbsp;long word has a syllable or two cut off;
or two or three are compressed into one. Thus <b>example</b> has become
<b>sample</b>; <b>alone</b> appears also as <b>lone</b>; <b>amend</b>
has been shortened into <b>mend</b>; <b>defend</b> has been cut down
into <b>fend</b> (as&nbsp;in <b>fender</b>); <b>manœuvre</b> has been
contracted into <b>manure</b> (both meaning originally to work with the
hand); <b>madam</b> becomes <b>’m</b> in <b>yes&nbsp;’m</b><a class =
"tag" name = "tag11" id = "tag11" href = "#note11">11</a>; and
<b>presbyter</b> has been squeezed down into <b>priest</b>.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag12" id = "tag12" href = "#note12">12</a> Other examples
of contraction are: <b>capital</b> and <b>cattle</b>; <b>chirurgeon</b>
(a&nbsp;worker with the hand) and <b>surgeon</b>; <b>cholera</b> and
<b>choler</b> (from chŏlos, the Greek word for <i>bile</i>);
<b>disport</b> and <b>sport</b>; <b>estate</b> and <b>state</b>;
<b>esquire</b> and <b>squire</b>; <b>Egyptian</b> and
<span class = "pagenum">238</span>
<!--png 056-->
<b>gipsy</b>; <b>emmet</b> and <b>ant</b>; <b>gammon</b> and
<b>game</b>; <b>grandfather</b> and <b>gaffer</b>; <b>grandmother</b>
and <b>gammer</b>; <b>iota</b> (the Greek letter <b>i</b>) and
<b>jot</b>; <b>maximum</b> and <b>maxim</b>; <b>mobile</b> and
<b>mob</b>; <b>mosquito</b> and <b>musket</b>; <b>papa</b> and
<b>pope</b>; <b>periwig</b> and <b>wig</b>; <b>poesy</b> and
<b>posy</b>; <b>procurator</b> and <b>proctor</b>; <b>shallop</b> and
<b>sloop</b>; <b>unity</b> and <b>unit</b>. It is quite evident that the
above pairs of words, although in reality one, have very different
meanings and uses.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapII_sec52" id = "partIII_chapII_sec52">52.</a>
<b>Difference of English Dialects.</b>&mdash;Another source of doublets
is to be found in the dialects of the English language. Almost every
county in England has its own dialect; but three main dialects stand out
with great prominence in our older literature, and these are the
<b>Northern</b>, the <b>Midland</b>, and the <b>Southern</b>. The
grammar of these dialects<a class = "tag" name = "tag13" id = "tag13"
href = "#note13">13</a> was different; their pronunciation of words was
different&mdash;and this has given rise to a splitting of one word into
two. In the North, we find a hard <b>c</b>, as in the <i>caster</i> of
<b>Lancaster</b>; in the Midlands, a&nbsp;soft <b>c</b>, as in
<b>Leicester</b>; in the South, a&nbsp;<b>ch</b>, as in
<b>Winchester</b>. We shall find similar differences of hardness and
softness in ordinary words. Thus we find <b>kirk</b> and <b>church</b>;
<b>canker</b> and <b>cancer</b>; <b>canal</b> and <b>channel</b>;
<b>deck</b> and <b>thatch</b>; <b>drill</b> and <b>thrill</b>;
<b>fan</b> and <b>van</b> (in&nbsp;a winnowing-machine); <b>fitch</b>
and <b>vetch</b>; <b>hale</b> and <b>whole</b>; <b>mash</b> and
<b>mess</b>; <b>naught</b>, <b>nought</b>, and <b>not</b>; <b>pike</b>,
<b>peak</b>, and <b>beak</b>; <b>poke</b> and <b>pouch</b>; <b>quid</b>
(a&nbsp;piece of tobacco for chewing) and <b>cud</b> (which means the
thing <i>chewed</i>); <b>reave</b> and <b>rob</b>; <b>ridge</b> and
<b>rig</b>; <b>scabby</b> and <b>shabby</b>; <b>scar</b> and
<b>share</b>; <b>screech</b> and <b>shriek</b>; <b>shirt</b> and
<b>skirt</b>; <b>shuffle</b> and <b>scuffle</b>; <b>spray</b> and
<b>sprig</b>; <b>wain</b> and <b>waggon</b>&mdash;and other pairs. All
of these are but different modes of pronouncing the same word in
different parts of England; but the genius of the language has taken
advantage of these different <b>ways of pronouncing</b> to make
different <b>words</b> out of them, and to give them different
functions, meanings, and uses.</p>

<h6>HISTORY OF THE GRAMMAR OF ENGLISH.</h6>

<b>The Oldest English Synthetic.</b>&mdash;The oldest English, or
Anglo-Saxon, that was brought over here in the fifth century, was a
language that showed the relations of words to each other by adding
different endings to words, or by <b>synthesis</b>. These endings are
called <b>inflexions</b>. Latin and Greek are highly inflected
languages; French and German have many more inflexions than modern
English; and ancient English (or&nbsp;Anglo-Saxon) also possessed a
large number of inflexions.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapIII_sec2" id = "partIII_chapIII_sec2">2.</a>
<b>Modern English Analytic.</b>&mdash;When, instead of inflexions,
a&nbsp;language employs small particles&mdash;such as prepositions,
auxiliary verbs, and suchlike words&mdash;to express the relations of
words to each other, such a language is called <b>analytic</b> or
<b>non-inflexional</b>. When we say, as we used to say in the oldest
English, “God is ealra cyninga cyning,” we speak a synthetic language.
But when we say, “God is king <i>of</i> all kings,” then we employ an
analytic or uninflected language.</p>

<b>Short View of the History of English Grammar.</b>&mdash;From the time
when the English language came over to this island, it has grown
steadily in the number of its words. On the other hand, it has lost just
as steadily in the number of its inflexions. Put in a broad and somewhat
rough fashion, it may be said that&mdash;</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapIII_sec4" id = "partIII_chapIII_sec4">4.</a>
<b>Causes of this Change.</b>&mdash;Even before the coming of the Danes
and the Normans, the English people had shown a tendency to get rid of
some of their inflexions. A&nbsp;similar tendency can be observed at the
present time among the Germans of the Rhine Province, who often drop an
<b>n</b> at the end of a word, and show in other respects a carelessness
about grammar. But, when a foreign people comes among natives, such a
tendency is naturally encouraged, and often greatly increased. The
natives discover that these inflexions are not so very important, if
only they can get their meaning rightly conveyed to the foreigners. Both
parties, accordingly, come to see that the <b>root</b> of the word is
the most important element; they stick to that, and they come to neglect
the mere inflexions. Moreover, the accent in English words always struck
the root; and hence this part of the word always fell on the ear with
the greater force, and carried the greater weight. When the
Danes&mdash;who spoke a cognate language&mdash;began to settle in
England, the tendency to drop inflexions increased; but when the
Normans&mdash;who spoke an entirely different language&mdash;came, the
tendency increased enormously, and the inflexions of Anglo-Saxon began
to “fall as the leaves fall” in the dry wind of a frosty October. Let us
try to trace some of these changes and losses.</p>

<b>Grammar of the First Period, 450-1100.</b>&mdash;The English of this
period is called the <b>Oldest English</b> or <b>Anglo-Saxon</b>. The
gender of nouns was arbitrary, or&mdash;it may be&mdash;poetical; it did
not, as in modern English it does, follow the sex. Thus <b>nama</b>,
a&nbsp;name, was masculine; <b>tunge</b>, a&nbsp;tongue, feminine; and
<b>eáge</b>, an eye, neuter. Like <i>nama</i>, the proper names of men
ended in <i>a</i>; and we find such names as Isa, Offa, Penda, as the
names of kings. Nouns at this period had five cases, with inflexions for
each; now we possess but one inflexion&mdash;that for the
possessive.&mdash;Even the definite article was inflected.&mdash;The
infinitive of verbs ended in <b>an</b>; and the sign
<i>to</i>&mdash;which we received from the
<span class = "pagenum">241</span>
<!--png 059-->
Danes&mdash;was not in use, except for the dative of the infinitive.
This dative infinitive is still preserved in such phrases as “a house to
let;” “bread to eat;” “water to drink.”&mdash;The present participle
ended in <b>ende</b> (in&nbsp;the North <b>ande</b>). This present
participle may be said still to exist&mdash;in spoken, but not in
written speech; for some people regularly say <i>walkin</i>,
<i>goin</i>, for <i>walking</i> and <i>going</i>.&mdash;The plural of
the present indicative ended in <b>ath</b> for all three persons. In the
perfect tense, the plural ending was <b>on</b>.&mdash;There was no
future tense; the work of the future was done by the present tense.
Fragments of this usage still survive in the language, as when we say,
“He goes up to town next week.”&mdash;Prepositions governed various
cases; and not always the objective (or&nbsp;accusative), as they do
now.</p>

<b>Grammar of the Second Period, 1100-1250.</b>&mdash;The English of
this period is called <b>Early English</b>. Even before the coming of
the Normans, the inflexions of our language had&mdash;as we have
seen&mdash;begun to drop off, and it was slowly on the way to becoming
an analytic language. The same changes&mdash;the same simplification of
grammar, has taken place in nearly every Low German language. But the
coming of the Normans hastened these changes, for it made the
inflexional endings of words of much less practical importance to the
English themselves.&mdash;Great changes took place in the pronunciation
also. The hard <b>c</b> or <b>k</b> was softened into <b>ch</b>; and the
hard guttural <b>g</b> was refined into a <b>y</b> or even into a silent
<b>w</b>.&mdash;A&nbsp;remarkable addition was made to the language. The
Oldest English or Anglo-Saxon had no indefinite article. They said
<i>ofer stán</i> for <i>on</i> a <i>rock</i>. But, as the French have
made the article <b>un</b> out of the Latin <b>unus</b>, so the English
pared down the northern <b>ane</b> (=&nbsp;<b>one</b>) into the article
<b>an</b> or <b>a</b>. The Anglo-Saxon definite article was <b>se</b>,
<b>seo</b>, <b>þaet</b>; and in the grammar of this Second Period it
became <b>þe</b>, <b>þeo</b>, <b>þe</b>.&mdash;The French plural in
<b>es</b> took the place of the English plural in <b>en</b>. But
<i>housen</i> and <i>shoon</i> existed for many centuries after the
Norman coming; and Mr&nbsp;Barnes, the Dorsetshire poet, still deplores
the ugly sound of <i>nests</i> and <i>fists</i>, and would like to be
able to say and to write <i>nesten</i> and <i>fisten</i>.&mdash;The
dative plural, which ended in <b>um</b>, becomes an <b>e</b> or an
<b>en</b>. The <b>um</b>,
<span class = "pagenum">242</span>
<!--png 060-->
however, still exists in the form of <b>om</b> in <b>seldom</b>
(=&nbsp;at few times) and <b>whilom</b> (=&nbsp;in old times).&mdash;The
gender of nouns falls into confusion, and begins to show a tendency to
follow the sex.&mdash;Adjectives show a tendency to drop several of
their inflexions, and to become as serviceable and accommodating as they
are now&mdash;when they are the same with all numbers, genders, and
cases.&mdash;The <b>an</b> of the infinitive becomes <b>en</b>, and
sometimes even the <b>n</b> is dropped.&mdash;<b>Shall</b> and
<b>will</b> begin to be used as tense-auxiliaries for the future
tense.</p>

<b>Grammar of the Third Period, 1250-1350.</b>&mdash;The English of this
period is often called <b>Middle English</b>.&mdash;The definite article
still preserves a few inflexions.&mdash;Nouns that were once masculine
or feminine become neuter, for the sake of convenience.&mdash;The
possessive in <b>es</b> becomes general.&mdash;Adjectives make their
plural in <b>e</b>.&mdash;The infinitive now takes <b>to</b> before
it&mdash;except after a few verbs, like <i>bid</i>, <i>see</i>,
<i>hear</i>, etc.&mdash;The present participle in <b>inge</b> makes its
appearance about the year 1300.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapIII_sec8" id = "partIII_chapIII_sec8">8.</a>
<b>Grammar of the Fourth Period, 1350-1485.</b>&mdash;This may be called
<b>Later Middle English</b>. An old writer of the fourteenth century
points out that, in his time&mdash;and before it&mdash;the English
language was “a-deled a thre,” divided into three; that is, that there
were three main dialects, the <b>Northern</b>, the <b>Midland</b>, and
the <b>Southern</b>. There were many differences in the grammar of these
dialects; but the chief of these differences is found in the plural of
the present indicative of the verb. This part of the verb formed its
plurals in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<table summary = "dialectal forms">
<tr>
<th><span class = "smallcaps">Northern.</span></th>
<th><span class = "smallcaps">Midland.</span></th>
<th><span class = "smallcaps">Southern.</span></th>

<td>We hopës</td>
<td>We hopen</td>
<td>We hopeth.</td>

<tr>
<td>They hopës</td>
<td>They hopen</td>
<td>They hopeth.<a class = "tag" name = "tag14" id = "tag14" href =
"#note14">14</a></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In time the Midland dialect conquered; and the East Midland form of
it became predominant all over England. As early as the beginning of the
thirteenth century, this dialect had thrown off most of the old
inflexions, and had become almost as flexionless
<span class = "pagenum">243</span>
<!--png 061-->
as the English of the present day. Let us note a few of the more
prominent changes.&mdash;The first personal pronoun <b>Ic</b> or
<b>Ich</b> loses the guttural, and becomes <b>I</b>.&mdash;The pronouns
<b>him</b>, <b>them</b>, and <b>whom</b>, which are true datives, are
used either as datives or as objectives.&mdash;The imperative plural
ends in <b>eth</b>. “Riseth up,” Chaucer makes one of his characters
say, “and stondeth by me!”&mdash;The useful and almost ubiquitous letter
<b>e</b> comes in as a substitute for <b>a</b>, <b>u</b>, and even
<b>an</b>. Thus <b>nama</b> becomes <b>name</b>, <b>sunu</b> (son)
becomes <b>sune</b>, and <b>withutan</b> changes into
<b>withute</b>.&mdash;The dative of adjectives is used as an adverb.
Thus we find <b>softë</b>, <b>brightë</b> employed like our
<b>softly</b>, <b>brightly</b>.&mdash;The <b>n</b> in the infinitive has
fallen away; but the <b>ë</b> is sounded as a separate syllable. Thus we
find <b>brekë</b>, <b>smitë</b> for <i>breken</i> and <i>smiten</i>.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapIII_sec9" id = "partIII_chapIII_sec9">9.</a>
<b>General View.</b>&mdash;In the time of King Alfred, the West-Saxon
speech&mdash;the Wessex dialect&mdash;took precedence of the rest, and
became the literary dialect of England. But it had not, and could not
have, any influence on the spoken language of other parts of England,
for the simple reason that very few persons were able to travel, and it
took days&mdash;and even weeks&mdash;for a man to go from Devonshire to
Yorkshire. In course of time the Midland dialect&mdash;that spoken
between the Humber and the Thames&mdash;became the predominant dialect
of England; and the East Midland variety of this dialect became the
parent of modern standard English. This predominance was probably due to
the fact that it, soonest of all, got rid of its inflexions, and became
most easy, pleasant, and convenient to use. And this disuse of
inflexions was itself probably due to the early Danish settlements in
the east, to the larger number of Normans in that part of England, to
the larger number of thriving towns, and to the greater and more active
communication between the eastern seaports and the Continent. The
inflexions were first confused, then weakened, then forgotten, finally
lost. The result was an extreme simplification, which still benefits all
learners of the English language. Instead of spending a great deal of
time on the learning of a large number of inflexions, which are to them
arbitrary and meaningless,
<span class = "pagenum">244</span>
<!--png 062-->
foreigners have only to fix their attention on the words and phrases
themselves, that is, on the very pith and marrow of the
language&mdash;indeed, on the language itself. Hence the great German
grammarian Grimm, and others, predict that English will spread itself
all over the world, and become the universal language of the future. In
addition to this almost complete sweeping away of all
inflexions,&mdash;which made Dr&nbsp;Johnson say, “Sir, the English
language has no grammar at all,”&mdash;there were other remarkable and
useful results which accrued from the coming in of the Norman-French and
other foreign elements.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapIII_sec10" id =
"partIII_chapIII_sec10">10.</a>
<b>Monosyllables.</b>&mdash;The stripping off of the inflexions of our
language cut a large number of words down to the root. Hundreds, if not
thousands, of our verbs were dissyllables, but, by the gradual loss of
the ending <b>en</b> (which was in Anglo-Saxon <b>an</b>), they became
monosyllables. Thus <b>bindan</b>, <b>drincan</b>, <b>findan</b>, became
<b>bind</b>, <b>drink</b>, <b>find</b>; and this happened with hosts of
other verbs. Again, the expulsion of the guttural, which the Normans
never could or would take to, had the effect of compressing many words
of two syllables into one. Thus <b>haegel</b>, <b>twaegen</b>, and
<b>faegen</b>, became <b>hail</b>, <b>twain</b>, and
<b>fain</b>.&mdash;In these and other ways it has come to pass that the
present English is to a very large extent of a monosyllabic character.
So much is this the case, that whole books have been written for
children in monosyllables. It must be confessed that the monosyllabic
style is often dull, but it is always serious and homely. We can find in
our translation of the Bible whole verses that are made up of words of
only one syllable. Many of the most powerful passages in Shakespeare,
too, are written in monosyllables. The same may be said of hundreds of
our proverbs&mdash;such as, “Cats hide their claws”; “Fair words please
fools”; “He that has most time has none to lose.” Great poets, like
Tennyson and Matthew Arnold, understand well the fine effect to be
produced from the mingling of short and long words&mdash;of the homely
English with the more ornate Romance language. In the following verse
from Matthew Arnold the words are all monosyllables, with the exception
of <i>tired</i> and <i>contention</i> (which is Latin):&mdash;</p>

<span class = "pagenum">245</span>
<!--png 063-->
<div class = "poem">
<p>“Let the long contention cease;</p>
<p>Geese are swans, and swans are geese;</p>
<p>Let them have it how they will,</p>
<p>Thou art tired. Best be still!”</p>
</div>

<p>In Tennyson’s “Lord of Burleigh,” when the sorrowful husband comes to
look upon his dead wife, the verse runs almost entirely in
monosyllables:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“And he came to look upon her,</p>
<p class = "two">
And he looked at her, and said:</p>
<p>‘Bring the dress, and put it on her,</p>
<p class = "two">
That she wore when she was wed.’”</p>
</div>

<p>An American writer has well indicated the force of the English
monosyllable in the following sonnet:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“Think not that strength lies in the big, <i>round</i> word,</p>
<p class = "two">
Or that the <i>brief</i> and <i>plain</i> must needs be weak.</p>
<p>To whom can this be true who once has heard</p>
<p class = "two">
The cry for help, the tongue that all men speak,</p>
<p>When want, or fear, or woe, is in the throat,</p>
<p class = "two">
So that each word gasped out is like a shriek</p>
<p><i>Pressed</i> from the sore heart, or a <i>strange</i>, wild
<i>note</i></p>
<p class = "two">
Sung by some <i>fay</i> or fiend! There is a strength,</p>
<p>Which dies if stretched too far, or spun too fine,</p>
<p class = "two">
Which has more height than breadth, more depth than length;</p>
<p>Let but this <i>force</i> of thought and speech be mine,</p>
<p class = "two">
And he that will may take the sleek fat <i>phrase</i>,</p>
<p>Which glows but burns not, though it beam and shine;</p>
<p class = "two">
Light, but no heat,&mdash;a flash, but not a blaze.”</p>
</div>

<p>It will be observed that this sonnet consists entirely of
monosyllables, and yet that the style of it shows considerable power and
vigour. The words printed in italics are all derived from Latin, with
the exception of the word <i>phrase</i>, which is Greek.</p>

<b>Change in the Order of Words.</b>&mdash;The syntax&mdash;or order of
words&mdash;of the oldest English was very different from that of
Norman-French. The syntax of an Old English sentence was clumsy and
involved; it kept the attention long on the strain; it was rumbling,
rambling, and unpleasant to the ear. It kept the attention on the
strain, because the verb in a subordinate clause was held back, and not
revealed till we had come to the
<span class = "pagenum">246</span>
<!--png 064-->
end of the clause. Thus the Anglo-Saxon wrote (though in different form
and spelling)&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quotation">
“When Darius saw, that he overcome be would.”</p>

<p>The newer English, under French influence, wrote&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quotation">
“When Darius saw that he was going to be overcome.”</p>

<p>This change has made an English sentence lighter and more easy to
understand, for the reader or hearer is not kept waiting for the verb;
but each word comes just when it is expected, and therefore in its
“natural” place. The Old English sentence&mdash;which is very like the
German sentence of the present day&mdash;has been compared to a heavy
cart without springs, while the newer English sentence is like a modern
well-hung English carriage. Norman-French, then, gave us a brighter,
lighter, freer rhythm, and therefore a sentence more easy to understand
and to employ, more supple, and better adapted to everyday use.</p>

<b>The Expulsion of Gutturals.</b>&mdash;(i)&nbsp;Not only did the
Normans help us to an easier and pleasanter kind of sentence, they aided
us in getting rid of the numerous throat-sounds that infested our
language. It is a remarkable fact that there is not now in the French
language a single guttural. There is not an <b>h</b> in the whole
language. The French <i>write</i> an <b>h</b> in several of their words,
but they never sound it. Its use is merely to serve as a fence between
two vowels&mdash;to keep two vowels separate, as in <i>la haine</i>,
hatred. No doubt the Normans could utter throat-sounds well enough when
they dwelt in Scandinavia; but, after they had lived in France for
several generations, they acquired a great dislike to all such sounds.
No doubt, too, many, from long disuse, were unable to give utterance to
a guttural. This dislike they communicated to the English; and hence, in
the present day, there are many people&mdash;especially in the south of
England&mdash;who cannot sound a guttural at all. The muscles in the
throat that help to produce these sounds have become
atrophied&mdash;have lost their power for want of practice. The purely
English part of the population, for many centuries after the Norman
invasion, could sound gutturals quite easily&mdash;just as the Scotch
<span class = "pagenum">247</span>
<!--png 065-->
and the Germans do now; but it gradually became the fashion in England
to leave them out.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapIII_sec13" id =
"partIII_chapIII_sec13">13.</a>
<b>The Expulsion of Gutturals.</b>&mdash;(ii)&nbsp;In some cases the
guttural disappeared entirely; in others, it was changed into or
represented by other sounds. The <b>ge</b> at the beginning of the
passive (or&nbsp;past) participles of many verbs disappeared entirely.
Thus <b>gebróht</b>, <b>gebóht</b>, <b>geworht</b>, became
<b>brought</b>, <b>bought</b>, and <b>wrought</b>. The <b>g</b> at the
beginning of many words also dropped off. Thus <b>Gyppenswich</b> became
<b>Ipswich</b>; <b>gif</b> became <b>if</b>; <b>genoh</b>,
<b>enough</b>.&mdash;The guttural at the end of words&mdash;hard
<b>g</b> or <b>c</b>&mdash;also disappeared. Thus <b>halig</b> became
<b>holy</b>; <b>eordhlic</b>, <b>earthly</b>; <b>gastlic</b>,
<b>ghastly</b> or <b>ghostly</b>. The same is the case in <b>dough</b>,
<b>through</b>, <b>plough</b>, etc.&mdash;the guttural appearing to the
eye but not to the ear.&mdash;Again, the guttural was changed into quite
different sounds&mdash;into labials, into sibilants, into other sounds
also. The following are a few examples:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The guttural has been softened, through Norman-French
influence, into a <b>sibilant</b>. Thus <b>rigg</b>, <b>egg</b>, and
<b>brigg</b> have become <b>ridge</b>, <b>edge</b>, and
<b>bridge</b>.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The guttural has become a
<b>labial</b>&mdash;<b>f</b>&mdash;as in <b>cough</b>, <b>enough</b>,
<b>trough</b>, <b>laugh</b>, <b>draught</b>, etc.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The guttural has become an additional syllable, and is
represented by a <b>vowel-sound</b>. Thus <b>sorg</b> and <b>mearh</b>
have become <b>sorrow</b> and <b>marrow</b>.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) In some words it has disappeared both to eye and ear. Thus
<b>makëd</b> has become <b>made</b>.</p>

<b>The Story of the GH.</b>&mdash;How is it, then, that we have in so
many words the two strongest gutturals in the language&mdash;<b>g</b>
and <b>h</b>&mdash;not only separately, in so many of our words, but
combined? The story is an odd one. Our Old English or Saxon scribes
wrote&mdash;not <b>light</b>, <b>might</b>, and <b>night</b>, but
<b>liht</b>, <b>miht</b>, and <b>niht</b>. When, however, they found
that the Norman-French gentlemen would not sound the <b>h</b>, and
say&mdash;as is still said in Scotland&mdash;<i>li</i><b>ch</b><i>t</i>,
&amp;c., they redoubled the guttural, strengthened the <b>h</b> with a
hard <b>g</b>, and again presented the dose to the Norman. But, if the
Norman could not sound the <b>h</b> alone, still less could he sound the
double guttural; and he very coolly let both alone&mdash;
<span class = "pagenum">248</span>
<!--png 066-->
ignored both. The Saxon scribe doubled the signs for his guttural, just
as a farmer might put up a strong wooden fence in front of a hedge; but
the Norman cleared both with perfect ease and indifference. And so it
came to pass that we have the symbol <b>gh</b> in more than seventy of
our words, and that in most of these we do not sound it at all. The
<b>gh</b> remains in our language, like a moss-grown boulder, brought
down into the fertile valley in a glacial period, when gutturals were
both spoken and written, and men believed in the truthfulness of
letters&mdash;but now passed by in silence and noticed by no one.</p>

<b>The Letters that represent Gutturals.</b>&mdash;The English guttural
has been quite Protean in the written or printed forms it takes. It
appears as an <b>i</b>, as a <b>y</b>, as a <b>w</b>, as a <b>ch</b>, as
a <b>dge</b>, as a <b>j</b>, and&mdash;in its more native forms&mdash;as
a <b>g</b>, a&nbsp;<b>k</b>, or a <b>gh</b>. The following words give
all these forms: ha<b>i</b>l, da<b>y</b>, fo<b>w</b>l, tea<b>ch</b>,
e<b>dge</b>, a<b>j</b>ar, dra<b>g</b>, truc<b>k</b>, and trou<b>gh</b>.
Now <i>hail</i> was <i>hagol</i>, <i>day</i> was <i>daeg</i>,
<i>fowl</i> was <i>fugol</i>, <i>teach</i> was <i>taecan</i>,
<i>edge</i> was <i>egg</i>, <i>ajar</i> was <i>achar</i>. In
<b>seek</b>, <b>beseech</b>, <b>sought</b>&mdash;which are all different
forms of the same word&mdash;we see the guttural appearing in three
different forms&mdash;as a hard <b>k</b>, as a soft <b>ch</b>, as an
unnoticed <b>gh</b>. In <b>think</b> and <b>thought</b>, <b>drink</b>
and <b>draught</b>, <b>sly</b> and <b>sleight</b>, <b>dry</b> and
<b>drought</b>, <b>slay</b> and <b>slaughter</b>, it takes two different
forms. In <b>dig</b>, <b>ditch</b>, and <b>dike</b>&mdash;which are all
the same word in different shapes&mdash;it again takes three forms. In
<b>fly</b>, <b>flew</b>, and <b>flight</b>, it appears as a <b>y</b>,
a&nbsp;<b>w</b>, and a <b>gh</b>. But, indeed, the manners of a
guttural, its ways of appearing and disappearing, are almost beyond
counting.</p>

<b>Grammatical Result of the Loss of Inflexions.</b>&mdash;When we look
at a Latin or French or German word, we know whether it is a verb or a
noun or a preposition by its mere appearance&mdash;by its face or by its
dress, so to speak. But the loss of inflexions which has taken place in
the English language has resulted in depriving us of this
advantage&mdash;if advantage it is. Instead of <b>looking</b> at the
<b>face</b> of a word in English, we are obliged to <b>think</b> of its
<b>function</b>,&mdash;that is, of what it does. We have, for example,
a&nbsp;large number of words that are both nouns and verbs&mdash;we may
use them as the one or as the other; and,
<span class = "pagenum">249</span>
<!--png 067-->
till we have used them, we cannot tell whether they are the one or the
other. Thus, when we speak of “a <b>cut</b> on the finger,” <b>cut</b>
is a <b>noun</b>, because it is a name; but when we say, “Harry cut his
finger,” then <b>cut</b> is a <b>verb</b>, because it tells something
about Harry. Words like <b>bud</b>, <b>cane</b>, <b>cut</b>,
<b>comb</b>, <b>cap</b>, <b>dust</b>, <b>fall</b>, <b>fish</b>,
<b>heap</b>, <b>mind</b>, <b>name</b>, <b>pen</b>, <b>plaster</b>,
<b>punt</b>, <b>run</b>, <b>rush</b>, <b>stone</b>, and many others, can
be used either as <b>nouns</b> or as <b>verbs</b>. Again, <b>fast</b>,
<b>quick</b>, and <b>hard</b> may be used either as <b>adverbs</b> or as
<b>adjectives</b>; and <b>back</b> may be employed as an <b>adverb</b>,
as a <b>noun</b>, and even as an <b>adjective</b>. Shakespeare is very
daring in the use of this licence. He makes one of his characters say,
“But me no buts!” In this sentence, the first <i>but</i> is a
<b>verb</b> in the imperative mood; the second is a <b>noun</b> in the
objective case. Shakespeare uses also such verbs as <i>to glad</i>,
<i>to mad</i>, such phrases as <i>a seldom pleasure</i>, and <i>the
fairest she</i>. Dr&nbsp;Abbott says, “In Elizabethan English, almost
any part of speech can be used as any other part of speech. An adverb
can be used as a verb, ‘they <i>askance</i> their eyes’; as a noun, ‘the
<i>backward</i> and abysm of time’; or as an adjective, ‘a seldom
pleasure.’ Any noun, adjective, or neuter verb can be used as an active
verb. You can ‘happy’ your friend, ‘malice’ or ‘fool’ your enemy, or
‘fall’ an axe upon his neck.” Even in modern English, almost any noun
can be used as a verb. Thus we can say, “to <i>paper</i> a room”; “to
<i>water</i> the horses”; “to <i>black-ball</i> a candidate”; to
“<i>iron</i> a shirt” or “a prisoner”; “to <i>toe</i> the line.” On the
other hand, verbs may be used as nouns; for we can speak of a
<i>work</i>, of a beautiful <i>print</i>, of a long <i>walk</i>, and
so&nbsp;on.</p>

<h6>SPECIMENS OF ENGLISH OF DIFFERENT PERIODS.</h6>


<p><a name = "partIII_chapIV_sec1" id = "partIII_chapIV_sec1">1.</a>
<b>Vocabulary and Grammar.</b>&mdash;The oldest English or Anglo-Saxon
differs from modern English both in vocabulary and in grammar&mdash;in
the words it uses and in the inflexions it employs. The difference is
often startling. And yet, if we look closely at the words and their
dress, we shall most often find that the words which look so strange are
the very words with which we are most familiar&mdash;words that we are
in the habit of using every day; and that it is their dress alone that
is strange and antiquated. The effect is the same as if we were to dress
a modern man in the clothes worn a thousand years ago: the chances are
that we should not be able to recognise even our dearest friend.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapIV_sec2" id = "partIII_chapIV_sec2">2.</a>
<b>A Specimen from Anglo-Saxon.</b>&mdash;Let us take as an example a
verse from the Anglo-Saxon version of one of the Gospels. The well-known
verse, Luke ii. 40, runs thus in our oldest English version:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quotation">
Sóþlíce ðaet cild weox, and waes gestrangod, wisdómes full; and Godes
gyfu waes on him.</p>

<p>Now this looks like an extract from a foreign language; but it is
not: it is our own veritable mother-tongue. Every word is pure ordinary
English; it is the dress&mdash;the spelling and the
inflexions&mdash;that is quaint and old-fashioned. This will be plain
from a literal translation:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quotation">
Soothly that child waxed, and was strengthened, wisdoms full
(=&nbsp;full of wisdom); and God’s gift was on him.</p>

<b>A Comparison.</b>&mdash;This will become plainer if we compare the
English of the Gospels as it was written in different periods of our
language. The alteration in the meanings of words, the changes in the
application of them, the variation in the use of phrases, the falling
away of the inflexions&mdash;all these things become plain to the eye
and to the mind as soon as we thoughtfully compare the different
versions. The following are extracts from the Anglo-Saxon version (995),
the version of Wycliffe (1389) and of Tyndale (1526), of the passage in
Luke ii. 44, 45:&mdash;</p>

applied to the different versions of the Lord’s Prayer that have come
down to us; and it will be seen from this comparison that the greatest
changes have taken place in the grammar, and especially in that part of
the grammar which contains the inflexions.</p>

<b>The English of the Thirteenth Century.</b>&mdash;In this century
there was a great breaking-down and stripping-off of inflexions. This is
seen in the <b>Ormulum</b> of Orm, a&nbsp;canon of the Order of
St&nbsp;Augustine, whose English is nearly as flexionless as that of
Chaucer, although about a century and a half before him. Orm has also
the peculiarity of always doubling a consonant after a short vowel.
Thus, in his introduction, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“Þiss boc iss nemmnedd Orrmulum</p>
<p>Forr þi þatt Orrm itt wrohhte.”</p>
</div>

<p>That is, “This book is named Ormulum, for the (reason) that Orm
wrought it.” The absence of inflexions is probably due to the fact that
the book is written in the East-Midland dialect. But, in a song called
“The Story of Genesis and Exodus,” written about 1250, we find a greater
number of inflexions. Thus we read:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“Hunger wex in lond Chanaan;</p>
<p>And his x sunes Jacob for-ðan</p>
<span class = "pagenum">255</span>
<!--png 073-->
<p>Sente in to Egypt to bringen coren;</p>
<p>He bilefe at hom ðe was gungest boren.”</p>
</div>

<p>That is, “Hunger waxed (increased) in the land of Canaan; and Jacob
for that (reason) sent his ten sons into Egypt to bring corn: he
remained at home that was youngest born.”</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapIV_sec9" id = "partIII_chapIV_sec9">9.</a>
<b>The English of the Fourteenth Century.</b>&mdash;The four greatest
writers of the fourteenth century are&mdash;in verse, <b>Chaucer</b> and
<b>Langlande</b>; and in prose, <b>Mandeville</b> and <b>Wycliffe</b>.
The inflexions continue to drop off; and, in Chaucer at least,
a&nbsp;larger number of French words appear. Chaucer also writes in an
elaborate verse-measure that forms a striking contrast to the homely
rhythms of Langlande. Thus, in the “Man of Lawes Tale,” we have the
verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“O queenës, lyvynge in prosperitée,</p>
<p>Duchessës, and ladyës everichone,</p>
<p>Haveth som routhe on hir adversitée;</p>
<p>An emperourës doughter stant allone;</p>
<p>She hath no wight to whom to make hir mone.</p>
<p>O blood roial! that stondest in this dredë</p>
<p>Fer ben thy frendës at thy gretë nedë!”</p>
</div>

<p>Here, with the exception of the imperative in <i>Haveth som
routhe</i> (=&nbsp;have some pity), <i>stant</i>, and <i>ben</i>
(=&nbsp;<i>are</i>), the grammar of Chaucer is very near the grammar of
to-day. How different this is from the simple English of Langlande! He
is speaking of the great storm of wind that blew on January 15,
1362:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“Piries and Plomtres &nbsp; weore passchet to þe grounde,</p>
<p>In ensaumple to Men &nbsp; þat we scholde do þe bettre,</p>
<p>Beches and brode okes &nbsp; weore blowen to þe eorþe.”</p>
</div>

<p>Here it is the spelling of Langlande’s English that differs most from
modern English, and not the grammar.&mdash;Much the same may be said of
the style of Wycliffe (1324-1384) and of Mandeville (1300-1372). In
Wycliffe’s version of the Gospel of Mark, v.&nbsp;26, he speaks of a
woman “that hadde suffride many thingis of ful many lechis (doctors),
and spendid alle hir thingis; and no-thing profitide.” Sir John
Mandeville’s English keeps many old inflexions and spellings; but is, in
other respects, modern enough. Speaking of Mahomet, he says: “And ȝee
<span class = "pagenum">256</span>
<!--png 074-->
schulle understonds that Machamete was born in Arabye, that was first a
pore knave that kept cameles, that wenten with marchantes for
marchandise.” <i>Knave</i> for boy, and <i>wenten</i> for went are the
two chief differences&mdash;the one in the use of words, the other in
grammar&mdash;that distinguish this piece of Mandeville’s English from
our modern speech.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapIV_sec10" id = "partIII_chapIV_sec10">10.</a>
<b>The English of the Sixteenth Century.</b>&mdash;This, which is also
called Tudor-English, differs as regards grammar hardly at all from the
English of the nineteenth century. This becomes plain from a passage
from one of Latimer’s sermons (1490-1555), “a&nbsp;book which gives a
faithful picture of the manners, thoughts, and events of the period.”
“My father,” he writes, “was a yeoman, and had no lands of his own, only
he had a farm of three or four pound a year at the uttermost, and
hereupon he tilled so much as kept half a dozen men. He had walk for a
hundred sheep; and my mother milked thirty kine.” In this passage, it is
only the old-fashionedness, homeliness, and quaintness of the
English&mdash;not its grammar&mdash;that makes us feel that it was not
written in our own times. When Ridley, the fellow-martyr of Latimer,
stood at the stake, he said, “I&nbsp;commit our cause to Almighty God,
which shall indifferently judge all.” Here he used <i>indifferently</i>
in the sense of <i>impartially</i>&mdash;that is, in the sense of
<i>making no difference between parties</i>; and this is one among a
very large number of instances of Latin words, when they had not been
long in our language, still retaining the older Latin meaning.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapIV_sec11" id = "partIII_chapIV_sec11">11.</a>
<b>The English of the Bible</b> (i).&mdash;The version of the Bible
which we at present use was made in 1611; and we might therefore suppose
that it is written in seventeenth-century English. But this is not the
case. The translators were commanded by James I. to “follow the Bishops’
Bible”; and the Bishops’ Bible was itself founded on the “Great Bible,”
which was published in 1539. But the Great Bible is itself only a
revision of Tyndale’s, part of which appeared as early as 1526. When we
are reading the Bible, therefore, we are reading English of the
sixteenth century, and, to a large extent, of the early part of that
century. It is true that successive generations of
<span class = "pagenum">257</span>
<!--png 075-->
printers have, of their own accord, altered the spelling, and even, to a
slight extent, modified the grammar. Thus we have <i>fetched</i> for the
older <i>fet</i>, <i>more</i> for <i>moe</i>, <i>sown</i> for
<i>sowen</i>, <i>brittle</i> for <i>brickle</i> (which gives the
connection with <i>break</i>), <i>jaws</i> for <i>chaws</i>,
<i>sixth</i> for <i>sixt</i>, and so on. But we still find such
participles as <i>shined</i> and <i>understanded</i>; and such phrases
as “they can skill to hew timber” (1&nbsp;Kings v.&nbsp;6), “abjects”
for <i>abject persons</i>, “three days agone” for <i>ago</i>, the
“captivated Hebrews” for “the captive Hebrews,” and others.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapIV_sec12" id = "partIII_chapIV_sec12">12.</a>
<b>The English of the Bible</b> (ii).&mdash;We have, again, old words
retained, or used in the older meaning. Thus we find, in Psalm
v.&nbsp;6, the phrase “them that speak leasing,” which reminds us of
King Alfred’s expression about “leasum spellum” (lying stories).
<i>Trow</i> and <i>ween</i> are often found; the “champaign over against
Gilgal” (Deut. xi.&nbsp;30) means the <i>plain</i>; and a publican in
the New Testament is a tax-gatherer, who sent to the Roman Treasury or
Publicum the taxes he had collected from the Jews. An “ill-favoured
person” is an ill-looking person; and “bravery” (Isa. iii.&nbsp;18) is
used in the sense of finery in dress.&mdash;Some of the oldest grammar,
too, remains, as in Esther viii.&nbsp;8, “Write ye, as it liketh you,”
where the <i>you</i> is a dative. Again, in Ezek. xxx.&nbsp;2, we find
“Howl ye, Woe worth the day!” where the imperative <i>worth</i> governs
<i>day</i> in the dative case. This idiom is still found in modern
verse, as in the well-known lines in the first canto of the “Lady of the
Lake”:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“Woe worth the chase, woe worth the day</p>
<p>That cost thy life, my gallant grey!”</p>

<h6>MODERN ENGLISH.</h6>


<p><a name = "partIII_chapV_sec1" id = "partIII_chapV_sec1">1.</a>
<b>Grammar Fixed.</b>&mdash;From the date of 1485&mdash;that is, from
the beginning of the reign of Henry VII.&mdash;the changes in the
grammar or constitution of our language are so extremely small, that
they are hardly noticeable. Any Englishman of ordinary education can
read a book belonging to the latter part of the fifteenth or to the
sixteenth century without difficulty. Since that time the grammar of our
language has hardly changed at all, though we have altered and enlarged
our vocabulary, and have adopted thousands of new words. The
introduction of Printing, the Revival of Learning, the Translation of
the Bible, the growth and spread of the power to read and
write&mdash;these and other influences tended to fix the language and to
keep it as it is to-day. It is true that we have dropped a few
old-fashioned endings, like the <b>n</b> or <b>en</b> in <i>silvern</i>
and <i>golden</i>; but, so far as form or grammar is concerned, the
English of the sixteenth and the English of the nineteenth centuries are
substantially the same.</p>

<p><a name = "partIII_chapV_sec2" id = "partIII_chapV_sec2">2.</a>
<b>New Words.</b>&mdash;But, while the grammar of English has remained
the same, the vocabulary of English has been growing, and growing
rapidly, not merely with each century, but with each generation. The
discovery of the New World in 1492 gave an impetus to maritime
enterprise in England, which it never lost, brought us into connection
with the Spaniards, and hence contributed to our language several
Spanish words. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Italian
literature
<span class = "pagenum">259</span>
<!--png 077-->
was largely read; Wyatt and Surrey show its influence in their poems;
and Italian words began to come in in considerable numbers. Commerce,
too, has done much for us in this way; and along with the article
imported, we have in general introduced also the name it bore in its own
native country. In later times, Science has been making rapid
strides&mdash;has been bringing to light new discoveries and new
inventions almost every week; and along with these new discoveries, the
language has been enriched with new names and new terms. Let us look a
little more closely at the character of these foreign contributions to
the vocabulary of our tongue.</p>

<b>Spanish Words.</b>&mdash;The words we have received from the Spanish
language are not numerous, but they are important. In addition to the
ill-fated word <b>armada</b>, we have the Spanish for <i>Mr</i>, which
is <b>Don</b> (from Lat. <i>dominus</i>, a&nbsp;lord), with its feminine
<b>Duenna</b>. They gave us also <b>alligator</b>, which is our English
way of writing <i>el lagarto</i>, the lizard. They also presented us
with a large number of words that end in <b>o</b>&mdash;such as
<b>buffalo</b>, <b>cargo</b>, <b>desperado</b>, <b>guano</b>,
<b>indigo</b>, <b>mosquito</b>, <b>mulatto</b>, <b>negro</b>,
<b>potato</b>, <b>tornado</b>, and others. The following is a tolerably

<b>Italian Words.</b>&mdash;Italian literature has been read and
cultivated in England since the time of Chaucer&mdash;since the
fourteenth century; and the arts and artists of Italy have for many
centuries exerted a great deal of influence on those of England. Hence
it is that we owe to the Italian language a large number of words. These
relate to poetry, such as <b>canto</b>, <b>sonnet</b>, <b>stanza</b>; to
music, as <b>pianoforte</b>, <b>opera</b>, <b>oratorio</b>,
<b>soprano</b>, <b>alto</b>, <b>contralto</b>; to architecture and
sculpture, as

<b>Dutch Words.</b>&mdash;We have had for many centuries commercial
dealings with the Dutch; and as they, like ourselves, are a great
seafaring people, they have given us a number of words relating to the
management of ships. In the fourteenth century, the southern part of the
German Ocean was the most frequented sea in the world; and the chances
of plunder were so great that ships of war had to keep cruising up and
down to protect the trading vessels that sailed between England and the
Low Countries. The following are the words which we owe to the
Netherlands:&mdash;</p>

<b>French Words.</b>&mdash;Besides the large additions to our language
made by the Norman-French, we have from time to time imported direct
from France a number of French words, without change in the spelling,
and with little change in the pronunciation. The French have been for
centuries the most polished nation in Europe; from France the changing
fashions in dress spread over all the countries of the Continent; French
literature has been much read in England since the time of Charles II.;
and for a long time all diplomatic correspondence between foreign
countries and England was carried on in French. Words relating to
manners and customs are common, such as <b>soirée</b>, <b>etiquette</b>,
<b>séance</b>, <b>élite</b>; and we have also the names of things which
were invented in France, such as <b>mitrailleuse</b>,
<b>carte-de-visite</b>, <b>coup d’état</b>, and others. Some of these
words are, in spelling, exactly like English; and advantage of this has
been taken in a well-known epigram:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Scotch have always had a closer connection with the French nation
than England; and hence we find in the Scottish dialect of English a
number of French words that are not used in South Britain at all.
A&nbsp;leg of mutton is called in Scotland a <b>gigot</b>; the dish on
which it is laid is an <b>ashet</b> (from <i>assiette</i>); a&nbsp;cup
for tea or for wine is a <b>tassie</b> (from <i>tasse</i>); the gate of
a town is
<span class = "pagenum">262</span>
<!--png 080-->
called the <b>port</b>; and a stubborn person is <b>dour</b> (Fr.
<i>dur</i>, from Lat. <i>durus</i>); while a gentle and amiable person
is <b>douce</b> (Fr. <i>douce</i>, Lat. <i>dulcis</i>).</p>

<b>German Words.</b>&mdash;It must not be forgotten that English is a
Low-German dialect, while the German of books is New High-German. We
have never borrowed directly from High-German, because we have never
needed to borrow. Those modern German words that have come into our
language in recent times are chiefly the names of minerals, with a few
striking exceptions, such as <b>loafer</b>, which came to us from the
German immigrants to the United States, and <b>plunder</b>, which seems
to have been brought from Germany by English soldiers who had served
under Gustavus Adolphus. The following are the German words which we
have received in recent times:&mdash;</p>

<b>Hebrew Words.</b>&mdash;These, with very few exceptions, have come to
us from the translation of the Bible, which is now in use in our homes
and churches. <b>Abbot</b> and <b>abbey</b> come from the Hebrew word
<b>abba</b>, father; and such words as <b>cabal</b> and <b>Talmud</b>,
though not found in the Old Testament, have been contributed by Jewish
literature. The following is a tolerably complete list:&mdash;</p>

<b>Other Foreign Words.</b>&mdash;The English have always been the
greatest travellers in the world; and our sailors always the most
daring, intelligent, and enterprising. There is hardly a port or a
country in the world into which an English ship has not penetrated; and
our commerce has now been maintained for centuries with every people on
the face of the globe. We exchange goods with almost every nation and
tribe under the

sun. When we import articles or produce from abroad, we in general
import the native name along with the thing. Hence it is that we have
<b>guano</b>, <b>maize</b>, and <b>tomato</b> from the two Americas;
<b>coffee</b>, <b>cotton</b>, and <b>tamarind</b> from Arabia;
<b>tea</b>, <b>congou</b>, and <b>nankeen</b> from China; <b>calico</b>,
<b>chintz</b>, and <b>rupee</b> from Hindostan; <b>bamboo</b>,
<b>gamboge</b>, and <b>sago</b> from the Malay Peninsula; <b>lemon</b>,
<b>musk</b>, and <b>orange</b> from Persia; <b>boomerang</b> and
<b>kangaroo</b> from Australia; <b>chibouk</b>, <b>ottoman</b>, and
<b>tulip</b> from Turkey. The following are lists of these foreign
words; and they are worth examining with the greatest
minuteness:&mdash;</p>

<b>Scientific Terms.</b>&mdash;A very large number of discoveries in
science have been made in this century; and a large number of inventions
have introduced these discoveries to the people, and made them useful in
daily life. Thus we have <i>telegraph</i> and <i>telegram</i>;
<i>photograph</i>; <i>telephone</i> and even
<i>photophone</i>.<!--photophone? when was this written??--> The word
<i>dynamite</i> is also modern; and the unhappy employment of it has
made it too widely known. Then passing fashions have given us such words
as <i>athlete</i> and <i>æsthete</i>. In general, it may be said that,
when we wish to give a name to a new thing&mdash;a&nbsp;new discovery,
invention, or fashion&mdash;we have recourse not to our own stores of
English, but to the vocabularies of the Latin and Greek languages.</p>

<h6>OUR OLDEST ENGLISH LITERATURE.</h6>


<p><a name = "partIV_chapI_sec1" id = "partIV_chapI_sec1">1.</a>
<b>Literature.</b>&mdash;The history of English Literature is, in its
external aspect, an account of the best books in prose and in verse that
have been written by English men and English women; and this account
begins with a poem brought over from the Continent by our countrymen in
the fifth century, and comes down to the time in which we live. It
covers, therefore, a&nbsp;period of nearly fourteen hundred years.</p>

<p><a name = "partIV_chapI_sec2" id = "partIV_chapI_sec2">2.</a>
<b>The Distribution of Literature.</b>&mdash;We must not suppose that
literature has always existed in the form of printed books. Literature
is a living thing&mdash;a&nbsp;living outcome of the living mind; and
there are many ways in which it has been distributed to other human
beings. The oldest way is, of course, by one person repeating a poem or
other literary composition he has made to another; and thus literature
is stored away, not upon book-shelves, but in the memory of living men.
Homer’s poems are said to have been preserved in this way to the Greeks
for five hundred years. Father chanted them to son; the sons to their
sons; and so on from generation to generation. The next way of
distributing literature is by the aid of signs called letters made upon
leaves, flattened reeds, parchment, or the inner bark of trees. The next
is by the help of writing upon paper. The last is by the aid of type
upon paper. This has existed in England for more than four hundred
years&mdash;since the year 1474; and thus it is that our libraries
contain many hundreds of thousands of valuable books.
<span class = "pagenum">272</span>
<!--png 090-->
For the same reason is it, most probably, that as our power of retaining
the substance and multiplying the copies of books has grown stronger,
our living memories have grown weaker. This defect can be remedied only
by education&mdash;that is, by training the memories of the young. While
we possess so many printed books, it must not be forgotten that many
valuable works exist still in manuscript&mdash;written either upon paper
or on parchment.</p>

<p><a name = "partIV_chapI_sec3" id = "partIV_chapI_sec3">3.</a>
<b>Verse, the earliest form of Literature.</b>&mdash;It is a remarkable
fact that the earliest kind of composition in all languages is in the
form of <b>Verse</b>. The oldest books, too, are those which are written
in verse. Thus Homer’s poems are the oldest literary work of Greece; the
Sagas are the oldest productions of Scandinavian literature; and the
Beowulf is the oldest piece of literature produced by the Anglo-Saxon
race. It is also from the strong creative power and the lively
inventions of poets that we are even now supplied with new thoughts and
new language&mdash;that the most vivid words and phrases come into the
language; just as it is the ranges of high mountains that send down to
the plains the ever fresh soil that gives to them their unending
fertility. And thus it happens that our present English speech is full
of words and phrases that have found their way into the most ordinary
conversation from the writings of our great poets&mdash;and especially
from the writings of our greatest poet, Shakespeare. The fact that the
life of prose depends for its supplies on the creative minds of poets
has been well expressed by an American writer:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">

<b>Our oldest English Poetry.</b>&mdash;The verse written by our old
English writers was very different in form from the verse that appears
now from the hands of Tennyson, or Browning, or Matthew Arnold. The old
English or Anglo-Saxon writers used a kind of rhyme called
<b>head-rhyme</b> or <b>alliteration</b>; while, from the fourteenth
century downwards, our poets have always employed <b>end-rhyme</b> in
their verses.</p>

<p class = "poem">
“<i>L</i>ightly down <i>l</i>eaping he <i>l</i>oosened his helmet.”
</p>

<p>Such was the rough old English form. At least three words in each
long line were alliterative&mdash;two in the first half, and one in the
second. Metaphorical phrases were common, such as <i>war-adder</i> for
arrow, <i>war-shirts</i> for armour, <i>whale’s-path</i> or
<i>swan-road</i> for the sea, <i>wave-horse</i> for a ship,
<i>tree-wright</i> for carpenter. Different statements of the same fact,
different phrases for the same thing&mdash;what are called
<b>parallelisms</b> in Hebrew poetry&mdash;as in the line&mdash;</p>

<p class = "poem">
“Then saw they the sea head-lands&mdash;the windy walls,”
</p>

<p>were also in common use among our oldest English poets.</p>

<p><a name = "partIV_chapI_sec5" id = "partIV_chapI_sec5">5.</a>
<b>Beowulf.</b>&mdash;The <b>Beowulf</b> is the oldest poem in the
English language. It is our “old English epic”; and, like much of our
ancient verse, it is a war poem. The author of it is unknown. It was
probably composed in the fifth century&mdash;not in England, but on the
Continent&mdash;and brought over to this island&mdash;not on paper or on
parchment&mdash;but in the memories of the old Jutish or Saxon vikings
or warriors. It was not written down at all, even in England, till the
end of the ninth century, and then, probably, by a monk of Northumbria.
It tells among other things the story of how Beowulf sailed from Sweden
to the help of Hrothgar, a&nbsp;king in Jutland, whose life was made
miserable by a monster&mdash;half man, half fiend&mdash;named Grendel.
For about twelve years this monster had been in the habit of creeping up
to the banqueting-hall of King Hrothgar, seizing upon his thanes,
carrying them off, and devouring them. Beowulf attacks and overcomes the
dragon, which is mortally wounded, and flees away to die. The
<span class = "pagenum">274</span>
<!--png 092-->
poem belongs both to the German and to the English literature; for it is
written in a Continental English, which is somewhat different from the
English of our own island. But its literary shape is, as has been said,
due to a Christian writer of Northumbria; and therefore its written or
printed form&mdash;as it exists at present&mdash;is not German, but
English. Parts of this poem were often chanted at the feasts of
warriors, where all sang in turn as they sat after dinner over their
cups of mead round the massive oaken table. The poem consists of 3184
lines, the rhymes of which are solely alliterative.</p>

<p><a name = "partIV_chapI_sec6" id = "partIV_chapI_sec6">6.</a>
<b>The First Native English Poem.</b>&mdash;The Beowulf came to us from
the Continent; the first native English poem was produced in Yorkshire.
On the dark wind-swept cliff which rises above the little land-locked
harbour of <b>Whitby</b>, stand the ruins of an ancient and once famous
abbey. The head of this religious house was the Abbess Hild or Hilda:
and there was a secular priest in it,&mdash;a&nbsp;very shy retiring
man, who looked after the cattle of the monks, and whose name was
<b>Caedmon</b>. To this man came the gift of song, but somewhat late in
life. And it came in this wise. One night, after a feast, singing began,
and each of those seated at the table was to sing in his turn. Caedmon
was very nervous&mdash;felt he could not sing. Fear overcame his heart,
and he stole quietly away from the table before the turn could come to
him. He crept off to the cowshed, lay down on the straw and fell asleep.
He dreamed a dream; and, in his dream, there came to him a voice:
“Caedmon, sing me a song!” But Caedmon answered: “I&nbsp;cannot sing; it
was for this cause that I had to leave the feast.” “But you must and
shall sing!” “What must I sing, then?” he replied. “Sing the beginning
of created things!” said the vision; and forthwith Caedmon sang some
lines in his sleep, about God and the creation of the world. When he
awoke, he remembered some of the lines that had come to him in sleep,
and, being brought before Hilda, he recited them to her. The Abbess
thought that this wonderful gift, which had come to him so suddenly,
must have come from God, received him into the monastery, made him a
monk, and
<span class = "pagenum">275</span>
<!--png 093-->
had him taught sacred history. “All this Caedmon, by remembering, and,
like a clean animal, ruminating, turned into sweetest verse.” His
poetical works consist of a metrical paraphrase of the Old and the New
Testament. It was written about the year 670; and he died in 680. It was
read and re-read in manuscript for many centuries, but it was not
printed in a book until the year 1655.</p>

<b>The War-Poetry of England.</b>&mdash;There were many poems about
battles, written both in Northumbria and in the south of England; but it
was only in the south that these war-songs were committed to writing;
and of these written songs there are only two that survive up to the
present day. These are the <b>Song of Brunanburg</b>, and the <b>Song of
the Fight at Maldon</b>. The first belongs to the date 938; the second
to 991. The Song of Brunanburg was inscribed in the <span class =
"smallcaps">Saxon Chronicle</span>&mdash;a&nbsp;current narrative of
events, written chiefly by monks, from the ninth century to the end of
the reign of Stephen. The song tells the story of the fight of King
Athelstan with Anlaf the Dane. It tells how five young kings and seven
earls of Anlaf’s host fell on the field of battle, and lay there
“quieted by swords,” while their fellow-Northmen fled, and left their
friends and comrades to “the screamers of war&mdash;the black raven, the
eagle, the greedy battle-hawk, and the grey wolf in the wood.” The Song
of the Fight at Maldon tells us of the heroic deeds and death of
<b>Byrhtnoth</b>, an ealdorman of Northumbria, in battle against the
Danes at Maldon, in Essex. The speeches of the chiefs are given; the
single combats between heroes described; and, as in Homer, the names and
genealogies of the foremost men are brought into the verse.</p>

<p><a name = "partIV_chapI_sec8" id = "partIV_chapI_sec8">8.</a>
<b>The First English Prose.</b>&mdash;The first writer of English prose
was <b>Baeda</b>, or, as he is generally called, the <b>Venerable
Bede</b>. He was born in the year 672 at Monkwearmouth, a&nbsp;small
town at the mouth of the river Wear, and was, like Caedmon,
a&nbsp;native of the kingdom of Northumbria. He spent most of his life
at the famous monastery of Jarrow-on-Tyne. He spent his life in writing.
His works, which were written in Latin, rose to the number of
forty-five; his chief
<span class = "pagenum">276</span>
<!--png 094-->
work being an <b>Ecclesiastical History</b>. But though Latin was the
tongue in which he wrote his books, he wrote one book in English; and he
may therefore be fairly considered the first writer of English prose.
This book was a <b>Translation of the Gospel of
St&nbsp;John</b>&mdash;a&nbsp;work which he laboured at until the very
moment of his death. His disciple Cuthbert tells the story of his last
hours. “Write quickly!” said Baeda to his scribe, for he felt that his
end could not be far off. When the last day came, all his scholars stood
around his bed. “There is still one chapter wanting, Master,” said the
scribe; “it is hard for thee to think and to speak.” “It must be done,”
said Baeda; “take thy pen and write quickly.” So through the long day
they wrote&mdash;scribe succeeding scribe; and when the shades of
evening were coming on, the young writer looked up from his task and
said, “There is yet one sentence to write, dear Master.” “Write it
quickly!” Presently the writer, looking up with joy, said, “It is
finished!” “Thou sayest truth,” replied the weary old man; “it is
finished: all is finished.” Quietly he sank back upon his pillow, and,
with a psalm of praise upon his lips, gently yielded up to God his
latest breath. It is a great pity that this translation&mdash;the first
piece of prose in our language&mdash;is utterly lost. No MS. of it is at
present known to be in existence.</p>

<b>The Father of English Prose.</b>&mdash;For several centuries, up to
the year 866, the valleys and shores of Northumbria were the homes of
learning and literature. But a change was not long in coming. Horde
after horde of Danes swept down upon the coasts, ravaged the
monasteries, burnt the books&mdash;after stripping the beautiful
bindings of the gold, silver, and precious stones which decorated
them&mdash;killed or drove away the monks, and made life, property, and
thought insecure all along that once peaceful and industrious coast.
Literature, then, was forced to desert the monasteries of Northumbria,
and to seek for a home in the south&mdash;in Wessex, the kingdom over
which Alfred the Great reigned for more than thirty years. The capital
of Wessex was Winchester; and an able writer says: “As
<span class = "pagenum">277</span>
<!--png 095-->
Whitby is the cradle of English poetry, so is Winchester of English
prose.” King Alfred founded colleges, invited to England men of learning
from abroad, and presided over a school for the sons of his nobles in
his own Court. He himself wrote many books, or rather, he translated the
most famous Latin books of his time into English. He translated into the
English of Wessex, for example, the ‘Ecclesiastical History’ of Baeda;
the ‘History of Orosius,’ into which he inserted geographical chapters
of his own; and the ‘Consolations of Philosophy,’ by the famous Roman
writer, Boëthius. In these books he gave to his people, in their own
tongue, the best existing works on history, geography, and
philosophy.</p>

<b>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.</b>&mdash;The greatest prose-work of the
oldest English, or purely Saxon, literature, is a work&mdash;not by one
person, but by several authors. It is the historical work which is known
as <b>The Saxon Chronicle</b>. It seems to have been begun about the
middle of the ninth century; and it was continued, with breaks now and
then, down to 1154&mdash;the year of the death of Stephen and the
accession of Henry&nbsp;II. It was written by a series of successive
writers, all of whom were monks; but Alfred himself is said to have
contributed to it a narrative of his own wars with the Danes. The
Chronicle is found in seven separate forms, each named after the
monastery in which it was written. It was the newspaper, the annals, and
the history of the nation. “It is the first history of any Teutonic
people in their own language; it is the earliest and most venerable
monument of English prose.” This Chronicle possesses for us a twofold
value. It is a valuable storehouse of historical facts; and it is also a
storehouse of specimens of the different states of the English
language&mdash;as regards both words and grammar&mdash;from the eighth
down to the twelfth century.</p>

<b>Layamon’s Brut.</b>&mdash;Layamon was a native of Worcestershire, and
a priest of Ernley on the Severn. He translated, about the year 1205,
a&nbsp;poem called <b>Brut</b>, from the French of a monkish writer
named Master Wace. Wace’s work itself is
<span class = "pagenum">278</span>
<!--png 096-->
little more than a translation of parts of a famous “Chronicle or
History of the Britons,” written in Latin by Geoffrey of Monmouth, who
was Bishop of St&nbsp;Asaph in 1152. But Geoffrey himself professed only
to have translated from a chronicle in the British or Celtic tongue,
called the “Chronicle of the Kings of Britain,” which was found in
Brittany&mdash;long the home of most of the stories, traditions, and
fables about the old British Kings and their great deeds. Layamon’s poem
called the “Brut” is a metrical chronicle of Britain from the landing of
Brutus to the death of King Cadwallader, about the end of the seventh
century. Brutus was supposed to be a great-grandson of Æneas, who sailed
west and west till he came to Great Britain, where he settled with his
followers.&mdash;This metrical chronicle is written in the dialect of
the West of England; and it shows everywhere a breaking down of the
grammatical forms of the oldest English, as we find it in the
Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. In fact, between the landing of the Normans and
the fourteenth century, two things may be noted: first, that during this
time&mdash;that is, for three centuries&mdash;the inflections of the
oldest English are gradually and surely stripped off; and, secondly,
that there is little or no original English literature given to the
country, but that by far the greater part consists chiefly of
translations from French or from Latin.</p>

<a name = "partIV_chapI_sec12" id = "partIV_chapI_sec12">12.</a>
<b>Orm’s Ormulum.</b>&mdash;Less than half a century after Layamon’s
Brut appeared a poem called the <b>Ormulum</b>, by a monk of the name of
Orm or Ormin. It was probably written about the year 1215. Orm was a
monk of the order of St&nbsp;Augustine, and his book consists of a
series of religious poems. It is the oldest, purest, and most valuable
specimen of thirteenth-century English, and it is also remarkable for
its peculiar spelling. It is written in the purest English, and not five
French words are to be found in the whole poem of twenty thousand short
lines. Orm, in his spelling, doubles every consonant that has a short
vowel before it; and he writes <i>pann</i> for <i>pan</i>, but
<i>pan</i> for <i>pane</i>. The following is a specimen of his
poem:&mdash;</p>

<h6>THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY.</h6>


<p><a name = "partIV_chapII_sec1" id = "partIV_chapII_sec1">1.</a>
The opening of the fourteenth century saw the death of the great and
able king, Edward I., the “Hammer of the Scots,” the “Keeper of his
word.” The century itself&mdash;a&nbsp;most eventful
period&mdash;witnessed the feeble and disastrous reign of Edward II.;
the long and prosperous rule&mdash;for fifty years&mdash;of Edward III.;
the troubled times of Richard II., who exhibited almost a repetition of
the faults of Edward II.; and the appearance of a new and powerful
dynasty&mdash;the House of Lancaster&mdash;in the person of the able and
ambitious Henry IV. This century saw also many striking events, and many
still more striking changes. It beheld the welding of the Saxon and the
Norman elements into one&mdash;chiefly through the French wars; the
final triumph of the English language over French in 1362; the frequent
coming of the Black Death; the victories of Crecy and Poitiers; it
learned the universal use of the mariner’s compass; it witnessed two
kings&mdash;of France and of Scotland&mdash;prisoners in London; great
changes in the condition of labourers; the invention of gunpowder in
1340; the rise of English commerce under Edward III.; and everywhere in
England the rising up of new powers and new ideas.</p>

The first prose-writer in this century is <b>Sir John Mandeville</b>
(who has been called the “Father of English Prose”). King Alfred has
also been called by this name; but as the English written by Alfred was
very different from that written
<span class = "pagenum">281</span>
<!--png 099-->
by Mandeville,&mdash;the latter containing a large admixture of French
and of Latin words, both writers are deserving of the epithet. The most
influential prose-writer was <b>John Wyclif</b>, who was, in fact, the
first English Reformer of the Church. In poetry, two writers stand
opposite each other in striking contrast&mdash;<b>Geoffrey Chaucer</b>
and <b>William Langlande</b>, the first writing in courtly “King’s
English” in end-rhyme, and with the fullest inspirations from the
literatures of France and Italy, the latter writing in head-rhyme,
and&mdash;though using more French words than Chaucer&mdash;with a style
that was always homely, plain, and pedestrian<ins class = "correction"
title = "period invisible">. </ins><b>John Gower</b>, in Kent, and
<b>John Barbour</b>, in Scotland, are also noteworthy poets in this
century. The English language reached a high state of polish, power, and
freedom in this period; and the sweetness and music of Chaucer’s verse
are still unsurpassed by modern poets. The sentences of the
prose-writers of this century are long, clumsy, and somewhat helpless;
but the sweet homely English rhythm exists in many of them, and was
continued, through Wyclif’s version, down into our translation of the
Bible in 1611.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Sir John Mandeville</span>,
(<b>1300-1372</b>), “the first prose-writer in formed English,” was born
at St&nbsp;Albans, in Hertfordshire, in the year 1300. He was a
physician; but, in the year 1322, he set out on a journey to the East;
was away from home for more than thirty years, and died at Liège, in
Belgium, in 1372. He wrote his travels first in Latin, next in French,
and then turned them into English, “that every man of my nation may

the writer himself went much further east&mdash;reached Cathay or China,
in fact. He introduced a large number of French words into our speech,
such as <i>cause</i>, <i>contrary</i>, <i>discover</i>, <i>quantity</i>,
and many hundred others. His works were much admired, read, and copied;
indeed, hundreds of manuscript copies of his book were made. There are
nineteen still in the British Museum. The book was not printed till the
year 1499&mdash;that is, twenty-five years after printing was introduced
into this country. Many of the Old English inflexions still survive in
his style. Thus he says: “Machamete was born in Arabye, that was a pore
knave (boy) that kepte cameles that went<i>en</i> with marchantes for
marchandise.”</p>

and his complete translation of the <b>Bible</b>. This work was finished
in 1383, just one year before his death. But the translation was not
done by himself alone; the larger part of the Old Testament version
seems to have been made by Nicholas de Hereford. Though often copied in
manuscript, it was not printed for several centuries. Wyclif’s New
Testament was printed in 1731, and the Old Testament not until the year
1850. But the words and the style of his translation, which was read and
re-read by hundreds of thoughtful men, were of real and permanent
service in fixing the language in the form in which we now

<span class = "smallcaps">John Gower</span> (<b>1325-1408</b>) was a
country gentleman of Kent. As Mandeville wrote his travels in three
languages, so did Gower his poems. Almost all educated persons in the
fourteenth century could read and write with tolerable and with almost
equal ease, English, French, and Latin. His three poems are the
<b>Speculum Meditantis</b> (“The Mirror of the Thoughtful Man”), in
French; the <b>Vox Clamantis</b> (“Voice of One Crying”), in Latin; and
<b>Confessio Amantis</b> (“The Lover’s Confession”), in English. No
manuscript of the first work is known to exist. He was buried in

poet who used the old English head-rhyme, as Chaucer used the foreign
end-rhyme, was born at Cleobury-Mortimer in Shropshire, in the year
1332. The date of his death is doubtful. His poem is called the
<b>Vision of Piers the Plowman</b>; and it is the last long poem in our
literature that was written in Old English alliterative rhyme. From this
period, if rhyme is employed at all, it is the end-rhyme, which we
borrowed from the French and Italians. The poem has an appendix called
<b>Do-well, Do-bet, Do-best</b>&mdash;the three stages in the growth of
a Christian. Langlande’s writings remained in manuscript until the reign
of Edward VI.; they were printed then, and went through three editions

<span class = "smallcaps">Geoffrey Chaucer</span> (<b>1340-1400</b>),
the “father of English poetry,” and the greatest narrative poet of this
country, was born in London in or about the year 1340. He lived in the
reigns of Edward III., Richard II., and one year in the reign of Henry
IV. His father was a vintner. The name <i>Chaucer</i> is a Norman name,
and is found on the roll of Battle Abbey. He is said to have studied
both at Oxford and Cambridge; served as page in the household of Prince
Lionel, Duke of Clarence, the third son of Edward III.; served also in
the army, and was taken prisoner in one of the French campaigns. In
1367, he was appointed gentleman-in-waiting (<i>valettus</i>) to Edward
III., who sent him on several embassies. In 1374 he married a lady of
the Queen’s chamber; and by this marriage he became connected with John
of Gaunt, who afterwards married a sister of this lady. While on an
embassy to Italy, he is reported to have met the great poet Petrarch,
who told him the story of the Patient Griselda. In 1381, he was made
Comptroller of Customs in the great port of London&mdash;an office which
he held till the year 1386. In that year he was elected knight of the
shire&mdash;that is, member of Parliament for the county of Kent. In
1389, he was appointed Clerk of the King’s Works at Westminster and
Windsor. From 1381 to 1389 was probably the best and most productive
period of his life; for it was in this period that he wrote the <b>House
of Fame</b>, the <b>Legend of Good Women</b>, and the best of the
<b>Canterbury Tales</b>. From 1390 to 1400 was spent in writing the
other <b>Canterbury Tales</b>, ballads, and some moral poems. He died at
Westminster in the year 1400, and was the first writer who was buried in
the Poets’ Corner of the Abbey. We see from his life&mdash;and it was
fortunate for his poetry&mdash;that Chaucer had the most varied
experience as student, courtier, soldier, ambassador, official, and
member of Parliament; and was able to mix freely and on equal terms with
all sorts and conditions of men, from the king to the poorest hind in
the fields. He was a stout man, with a small bright face, soft eyes,

dazed by long and hard reading, and with the English passion for
flowers, green fields, and all the sights and sounds of nature.</p>

<b>Chaucer’s Works.</b>&mdash;Chaucer’s greatest work is the
<b>Canterbury Tales</b>. It is a collection of stories written in heroic
metre&mdash;that is, in the rhymed couplet of five iambic feet. The
finest part of the Canterbury Tales is the <b>Prologue</b>; the noblest
story is probably the <b>Knightes Tale</b>. It is worthy of note that,
in 1362, when Chaucer was a very young man, the session of the House of
Commons was first opened with a speech in English; and in the same year
an Act of Parliament was passed, substituting the use of English for
French in courts of law, in schools, and in public offices. English had
thus triumphed over French in all parts of the country, while it had at
the same time become saturated with French words. In the year 1383 the
Bible was translated into English by Wyclif. Thus Chaucer, whose
writings were called by Spenser “the well of English undefiled,” wrote
at a time when our English was freshest and newest. The grammar of his
works shows English with a large number of inflexions still remaining.
The Canterbury Tales are a series of stories supposed to be told by a
number of pilgrims who are on their way to the shrine of St&nbsp;Thomas
(Becket) at Canterbury. The pilgrims, thirty-two in number, are fully
described&mdash;their dress, look, manners, and character in the
Prologue. It had been agreed, when they met at the Tabard Inn in
Southwark, that each pilgrim should tell four stories&mdash;two going
and two returning&mdash;as they rode along the grassy lanes, then the
only roads, to the old cathedral city. But only four-and-twenty stories
exist.</p>

<b>Chaucer’s Style.</b>&mdash;Chaucer expresses, in the truest and
liveliest way, “the true and lively of everything which is set before
him;” and he first gave to English poetry that force, vigour, life, and
colour which raised it above the level of mere rhymed prose. All the
best poems and histories in Latin, French, and Italian were well known
to Chaucer; and he borrows from them with the greatest freedom. He
handles, with masterly power, all the characters and events in his
Tales; and he is hence, beyond doubt, the greatest narrative poet that
England ever produced. In the Prologue, his masterpiece, Dryden says,
“we have our forefathers and great-grand-dames all before us, as they
were in Chaucer’s days.” His dramatic power, too, is nearly as great as
his narrative power; and Mr&nbsp;Marsh affirms that he was “a dramatist
before that which is technically known as the existing drama had been
invented.” That is to say, he could set men and women talking as they
would and did talk in real life, but with more point, spirit,
<i>verve</i>, and picturesqueness. As regards the matter of his poems,
it may be sufficient to say that
<span class = "pagenum">285</span>
<!--png 103-->
Dryden calls him “a perpetual fountain of good sense;” and that Hazlitt
makes this remark: “Chaucer was the most practical of all the great
poets,&mdash;the most a man of business and of the world. His poetry
reads like history.” Tennyson speaks of him thus in his “Dream of Fair
Women”:&mdash;</p>

(<b>1316-1396</b>).&mdash;The earliest Scottish poet of any importance
in the fourteenth century is John Barbour, who rose to be Archdeacon of
Aberdeen. Barbour was of Norman blood, and wrote Northern English, or,
as it is sometimes called, Scotch. He studied both at Oxford and at the
University of Paris. His chief work is a poem called <b>The Bruce</b>.
The English of this poem does not differ very greatly from the English
of Chaucer. Barbour has <i>fechtand</i> for <i>fighting</i>;
<i>pressit</i> for <i>pressëd</i>; <i>theretill</i> for <i>thereto</i>;
but these differences do not make the reading of his poem very
difficult. As a Norman he was proud of the doings of Robert de Bruce,
another Norman; and Barbour must often have heard stories of him in his
boyhood, as he was only thirteen when Bruce died.</p>

<h6>THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY.</h6>


<p><a name = "partIV_chapIII_sec1" id = "partIV_chapIII_sec1">1.</a>
The fifteenth century, a remarkable period in many ways, saw three royal
dynasties established in England&mdash;the Houses of Lancaster, York,
and Tudor. Five successful French campaigns of Henry V., and the battle
of Agincourt; and, on the other side, the loss of all our large
possessions in France, with the exception of Calais, under the rule of
the weak Henry VI., were among the chief events of the fifteenth
century. The Wars of the Roses did not contribute anything to the
prosperity of the century, nor could so unsettled and quarrelsome a time
encourage the cultivation of literature. For this among other reasons,
we find no great compositions in prose or verse; but a considerable
activity in the making and distribution of ballads. The best of these
are <b>Sir Patrick Spens</b>, <b>Edom o’ Gordon</b>, <b>The Nut-Brown
Mayde</b>, and some of those written about <b>Robin Hood</b> and his
exploits. The ballad was everywhere popular; and minstrels sang them in
every city and village through the length and breadth of England. The
famous ballad of <b>Chevy Chase</b> is generally placed after the year
1460, though it did not take its present form till the seventeenth
century. It tells the story of the Battle of Otterburn, which was fought
in 1388. This century was also witness to the short struggle of Richard
III., followed by the rise of the House of Tudor. And, in 1498, just at
its close, the wonderful apparition of a new world&mdash;of <b>The New
World</b>&mdash;
<span class = "pagenum">287</span>
<!--png 105-->
rose on the horizon of the English mind, for England then first heard of
the discovery of America. But, as regards thinking and writing, the
fifteenth century is the most barren in our literature. It is the most
barren in the <b>production</b> of original literature; but, on the
other hand, it is, compared with all the centuries that preceded it, the
most fertile in the dissemination and <b>distribution</b> of the
literature that already existed. For England saw, in the memorable year
of <b>1474</b>, the establishment of the first printing-press in the
Almonry at Westminster, by <b>William Caxton</b>. The first book printed
by him in this country was called ‘The Game and Playe of the Chesse.’
When Edward IV. and his friends visited Caxton’s house and looked at his
printing-press, they spoke of it as a pretty toy; they could not foresee
that it was destined to be a more powerful engine of good government and
the spread of thought and education than the Crown, Parliaments, and
courts of law all put together. The two greatest names in literature in
the fifteenth century are those of <b>James I.</b> (of&nbsp;Scotland)
and <b>William Caxton</b> himself. Two followers of Chaucer,
<b>Occleve</b> and <b>Lydgate</b> are also generally mentioned. Put
shortly, one might say that the chief poetical productions of this
century were its <b>ballads</b>; and the chief prose productions,
<b>translations</b> from Latin or from foreign works.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">James I. of Scotland</span>
(<b>1394-1437</b>), though a Scotchman, owed his education to England.
He was born in 1394. Whilst on his way to France when a boy of eleven,
he was captured, in time of peace, by the order of Henry IV., and kept
prisoner in England for about eighteen years. It was no great
misfortune, for he received from Henry the best education that England
could then give in language, literature, music, and all knightly
accomplishments. He married Lady Jane Beaufort, the grand-daughter of
John of Gaunt, the friend and patron of Chaucer. His best and longest
poem is <b>The Kings Quair</b> (that is, Book), a&nbsp;poem which was
inspired by the subject of it, Lady Jane Beaufort herself. The poem is
written in a stanza of seven lines (called <b>Rime Royal</b>); and the
style is a close copy of the style of Chaucer. After reigning thirteen
years in Scotland, King James was murdered at Perth, in the year 1437.
A&nbsp;Norman by blood, he is the best poet of the fifteenth
century.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">William Caxton</span> (<b>1422-1492</b>) is
the name of greatest importance and significance in the history of our
literature in the fifteenth century. He was born in Kent in the year
1422. He was not merely a printer, he was also a literary man; and, when
he devoted himself to printing, he took to it as an art, and not as a
mere mechanical device. Caxton in early life was a mercer in the city of
London; and in the course of his business, which was a thriving one, he
had to make frequent journeys to the Low Countries. Here he saw the
printing-press for the first time, with the new separate types, was
enchanted with it, and fired by the wonderful future it opened. It had
been introduced into Holland about the year 1450. Caxton’s press was set
up in the Almonry at Westminster, at the sign of the Red Pole. It
produced in all sixty-four books, nearly all of them in English, some of
them written by Caxton himself. One of the most important of them was
Sir Thomas Malory’s <b>History of King Arthur</b>, the storehouse from
which Tennyson drew the stories which form the groundwork of his
<i>Idylls of the King</i>.</p>

The Wars of the Roses ended in 1485, with the victory of Bosworth Field.
A&nbsp;new dynasty&mdash;the House of Tudor&mdash;sat upon the throne of
England; and with it a new reign of peace and order existed in the
country, for the power of the king was paramount, and the power of the
nobles had been gradually destroyed in the numerous battles of the
fifteenth century. Like the fifteenth, this century also is famous for
its ballads, the authors of which are not known, but which seem to have
been composed “by the people for the people.” They were sung everywhere,
at fairs and feasts, in town and country, at going to and coming home
from work; and many of them were set to popular dance-tunes.</p>

The first half of the sixteenth century saw the beginning of a new era
in poetry; and the last half saw the full meridian splendour of this new
era. The beginning of this era was marked by the appearance of <b>Sir
Thomas Wyatt</b> (1503-1542), and of the <b>Earl of Surrey</b>
(1517-1547). These two eminent
<span class = "pagenum">290</span>
<!--png 108-->
writers have been called the “twin-stars of the dawn,” the “founders of
English lyrical poetry”; and it is worthy of especial note, that it is
to Wyatt that we owe the introduction of the <b>Sonnet</b> into our
literature, and to Surrey that is due the introduction of <b>Blank
Verse</b>. The most important prose-writers of the first half of the
century were <b>Sir Thomas More</b>, the great lawyer and statesman, and
<b>William Tyndale</b>, who translated the New Testament into English.
In the latter half of the century, the great poets are <b>Spenser</b>
and <b>Shakespeare</b>; the great prose-writers, <b>Richard Hooker</b>
and <b>Francis Bacon</b>.</p>

Magdalen Hall, Oxford. His opinions on religion and the rule of the
Catholic Church, compelled him to leave England, and drove him to the
Continent in the year 1523. He lived in Hamburg for some time. With the
German and Swiss reformers he held that the Bible should be in the hands
of every grown-up person, and not in the exclusive keeping of the
Church. He accordingly set to work to translate the Scriptures into his
native tongue. Two editions of his version of the <b>New Testament</b>
were printed in 1525-34. He next translated the five books of Moses, and
the book of Jonah. In 1535 he was, after many escapes and adventures,
finally tracked and hunted down by an emissary of the Pope’s faction,
and thrown into prison at the castle of Vilvoorde, near Brussels. In
1536 he was brought to Antwerp, tried, condemned, led to the stake,
strangled, and burned.</p>

<b>The Work of William Tyndale.</b>&mdash;Tyndale’s translation has,
since the time of its appearance, formed the basis of all the after
versions of the Bible. It is written in the purest and simplest English;
and very few of the words used in his translation have grown obsolete in
our modern speech. Tyndale’s work is indeed,
<span class = "pagenum">291</span>
<!--png 109-->
one of the most striking landmarks in the history of our language.
Mr&nbsp;Marsh says of it: “Tyndale’s translation of the New Testament is
the most important philological monument of the first half of the
sixteenth century,&mdash;perhaps I should say, of the whole period
between Chaucer and Shakespeare.... The best features of the translation
of 1611 are derived from the version of Tyndale.” It may be said without
exaggeration that, in the United Kingdom, America, and the colonies,
about one hundred millions of people now speak the English of Tyndale’s
Bible; nor is there any book that has exerted so great an influence on
English rhythm, English style, the selection of words, and the build of
sentences in our English prose.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Edmund Spenser</span> (<b>1552-1599</b>), “The
Poet’s Poet,” and one of the greatest poetical writers of his own or of
any age, was born at East Smithfield, near the Tower of London, in the
year 1552, about nine years before the birth of Bacon, and in the reign
of Edward VI. He was educated at Merchant Taylors’ School in London, and
at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge. In 1579, we find him settled in his native
city, where his best friend was the gallant Sir Philip Sidney, who
introduced him to his uncle, the Earl of Leicester, then at the height
of his power and influence with Queen Elizabeth. In the same year was
published his first poetical work, <b>The Shepheard’s
Calendar</b>&mdash;a&nbsp;set of twelve pastoral poems. In 1580, he went
to Ireland as Secretary to Lord Grey de Wilton, the Viceroy of that
country. For some years he resided at Kilcolman Castle, in county Cork,
on an estate which had been granted him out of the forfeited lands of
the Earl of Desmond. Sir Walter Raleigh had obtained a similar but
larger grant, and was Spenser’s near neighbour. In 1590 Spenser brought
out the first three books of <b>The Faerie Queene</b>. The second three
books of his great poem appeared in 1596. Towards the end of 1598,
a&nbsp;rebellion broke out in Ireland; it spread into Munster; Spenser’s
house was attacked and set on fire; in the fighting and confusion his
only son perished; and Spenser escaped with the greatest difficulty. In
deep distress of body and mind, he made his way to London, where he
died&mdash;at an inn in King Street, Westminster, at the age of
forty-six, in the beginning of the year 1599. He was buried in the
Abbey, not far from the grave of Chaucer.</p>

<b>Spenser’s Style.</b>&mdash;His greatest work is <b>The Faerie
Queene</b>; but that in which he shows the most striking command of
language is his <b>Hymn of Heavenly Love</b>. <b>The Faerie Queene</b>
is written in a nine-lined stanza, which has since been called the
<i>Spenserian
<span class = "pagenum">292</span>
<!--png 110-->
Stanza</i>. The first eight lines are of the usual length of five iambic
feet; the last line contains six feet, and is therefore an Alexandrine.
Each stanza contains only three rhymes, which are disposed in this
order: <i>a&nbsp;b a b b c b c&nbsp;c</i>.&mdash;The music of the stanza
is long-drawn out, beautiful, involved, and even luxuriant.&mdash;The
story of the poem is an allegory, like the ‘Pilgrim’s Progress’; and in
it Spenser undertook, he says, “to represent all the moral virtues,
assigning to every virtue a knight to be the patron and defender of the
same.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag17" id = "tag17" href =

<b>Character of the Faerie Queene.</b>&mdash;This poem is the greatest
of the sixteenth century. Spenser has not only been the delight of
nearly ten generations; he was the study of Shakespeare, the poetical
master of Cowley and of Milton, and, in some sense, of Dryden and Pope.
Keats, when a boy, was never tired of reading him. “There is something,”
says Pope, “in Spenser that pleases one as strongly in old age as it did
in one’s youth.” Professor Craik says: “Without calling Spenser the
greatest of all poets, we may still say that his poetry is the most
poetical of all poetry.” The outburst of national feeling after the
defeat of the Armada in 1588; the new lands opened up by our adventurous
Devonshire sailors; the strong and lively loyalty of the nation to the
queen; the great statesmen and writers of the period; the high daring
shown by England against Spain&mdash;all these animated and inspired the
glowing genius of Spenser. His rhythm is singularly sweet and beautiful.
Hazlitt says: “His versification is at once the most smooth and the most
sounding in the language. It is a labyrinth of sweet sounds.” Nothing
can exceed the wealth of Spenser’s phrasing and expression; there seems
to be no limit to its flow. He is very fond of the Old-English practice
of alliteration or head-rhyme&mdash;“hunting the letter,” as it was
called. Thus he has&mdash;</p>

he quitted his native town, and went to London.</p>

<b>Shakespeare’s Life and Character.</b>&mdash;He was employed in some
menial capacity at the Blackfriars Theatre, but gradually rose to be
actor and also adapter of plays. He was connected with the theatre for
about five-and-twenty years; and so diligent and so successful was he,
that he was able to purchase shares both in his own theatre and in the
Globe. As an actor, he was only second-rate: the two parts he is known
to have played are those of the <i>Ghost</i> in <b>Hamlet</b>, and
<i>Adam</i> in <b>As You Like It</b>. In 1597, at the early age of
thirty-three, he was able to purchase New Place, in Stratford, and to
rebuild the house. In 1612, at the age of forty-eight, he left London
altogether, and retired for the rest of his life to New Place, where he
died in the year 1616. His old father and mother spent the last years of
their lives with him, and died under his roof. Shakespeare had three
children&mdash;two girls and a boy. The boy, Hamnet, died at the age of
twelve. Shakespeare himself was beloved by every one who knew him; and
“gentle Shakespeare” was the phrase most often upon the lips of his
friends. A&nbsp;placid face, with a sweet, mild expression; a&nbsp;high,
broad, noble, “two-storey” forehead; bright eyes; a&nbsp;most speaking
mouth&mdash;though it seldom opened; an open, frank manner,
a&nbsp;kindly, handsome look,&mdash;such seems to have been the external
character of the man Shakespeare.</p>

<b>Shakespeare’s Works.</b>&mdash;He has written thirty-seven plays and
many poems. The best of his rhymed poems are his Sonnets, in which he
chronicles many of the various moods of his mind. The plays consist of
tragedies, historical plays, and comedies. The greatest of his tragedies
are probably <b>Hamlet</b> and <b>King Lear</b>; the best of his
historical plays, <b>Richard III.</b> and <b>Julius Cæsar</b>; and his
finest comedies, <b>Midsummer Night’s Dream</b> and <b>As You Like
It</b>. He wrote in the reign of Elizabeth as well as in that of James;
but his greatest works belong to the latter period.</p>

<b>Shakespeare’s Style.</b>&mdash;Every one knows that Shakespeare is
great; but how is the young learner to discover the best way of forming
an adequate idea of his greatness? In the first place, Shakespeare has
very many sides; and, in the second place, he is great on every one of
them. Coleridge says: “In all points, from the most important to the
most minute, the judgment of Shakespeare
<span class = "pagenum">294</span>
<!--png 112-->
is commensurate with his genius&mdash;nay, his genius reveals itself in
his judgment, as in its most exalted form.” He has been called
“mellifluous Shakespeare;” “honey-tongued Shakespeare;” “silver-tongued
Shakespeare;” “the thousand-souled Shakespeare;” “the myriad-minded;”
and by many other epithets. He seems to have been master of all human
experience; to have known the human heart in all its phases; to have
been acquainted with all sorts and conditions of men&mdash;high and low,
rich and poor; and to have studied the history of past ages, and of
other countries. He also shows a greater and more highly skilled mastery
over language than any other writer that ever lived. The vocabulary
employed by Shakespeare amounts in number of words to twenty-one
thousand. The vocabulary of Milton numbers only seven thousand words.
But it is not sufficient to say that Shakespeare’s power of thought, of
feeling, and of expression required three times the number of words to
express itself; we must also say that Shakespeare’s power of expression
shows infinitely greater skill, subtlety, and cunning than is to be
found in the works of Milton. Shakespeare had also a marvellous power of
making new phrases, most of which have become part and parcel of our
language. Such phrases as <i>every inch a king</i>; <i>witch the
world</i>; <i>the time is out of joint</i>, and hundreds more, show that
modern Englishmen not only speak Shakespeare, but think Shakespeare. His
knowledge of human nature has enabled him to throw into English
literature a larger number of genuine “characters” that will always live
in the thoughts of men, than any other author that ever wrote. And he
has not drawn his characters from England alone and from his own
time&mdash;but from Greece and Rome, from other countries, too, and also
from all ages. He has written in a greater variety of styles than any
other writer. “Shakespeare,” says Professor Craik, “has invented twenty
styles.” The knowledge, too, that he shows on every kind of human
endeavour is as accurate as it is varied. Lawyers say that he was a
great lawyer; theologians, that he was an able divine, and unequalled in
his knowledge of the Bible; printers, that he must have been a printer;
and seamen, that he knew every branch of the sailor’s craft.</p>

<b>Shakespeare’s contemporaries.</b>&mdash;But we are not to suppose
that Shakespeare stood alone in the end of the sixteenth and the
beginning of the seventeenth century as a great poet; and that
everything else was flat and low around him. This never is and never can
be the case. Great genius is the possession, not of one man, but of
several in a great age; and we do not find a great writer standing alone
and unsupported, just as we do not find a high mountain rising
<span class = "pagenum">295</span>
<!--png 113-->
from a low plain. The largest group of the highest mountains in the
world, the Himalayas, rise from the highest table-land in the world; and
peaks nearly as high as the highest&mdash;Mount Everest&mdash;are seen
cleaving the blue sky in the neighbourhood of Mount Everest itself. And
so we find Shakespeare surrounded by dramatists in some respects nearly
as great as himself; for the same great forces welling up within the
heart of England that made <i>him</i> created also the others.
<b>Marlowe</b>, the teacher of Shakespeare, <b>Peele</b>, and
<b>Greene</b>, preceded him; <b>Ben Jonson</b>, <b>Beaumont</b> and
<b>Fletcher</b>, <b>Massinger</b> and <b>Ford</b>, <b>Webster</b>,
<b>Chapman</b>, and many others, were his contemporaries, lived with
him, talked with him; and no doubt each of these men influenced the work
of the others. But the works of these men belong chiefly to the
seventeenth century. We must not, however, forget that the reign of
Queen Elizabeth&mdash;called in literature the <b>Elizabethan
Period</b>&mdash;was the greatest that England ever saw,&mdash;greatest
in poetry and in prose, greatest in thought and in action, perhaps also
greatest in external events.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Christopher Marlowe</span> (<b>1564-1593</b>),
the first great English dramatist, was born at Canterbury in the year
1564, two months before the birth of Shakespeare himself. He studied at
Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and took the degree of Master of Arts
in 1587. After leaving the university, he came up to London and wrote
for the stage. He seems to have led a wild and reckless life, and was
stabbed in a tavern brawl on the 1st of June 1593. “As he may be said to
have invented and made the verse of the drama, so he created the English
drama.” His chief plays are <b>Dr&nbsp;Faustus</b> and <b>Edward the
Second</b>. His style is one of the greatest vigour and power: it is
often coarse, but it is always strong. Ben Jonson spoke of “Marlowe’s
mighty line”; and Lord Jeffrey says of him: “In felicity of thought and
strength of expression, he is second only to Shakespeare himself.”</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Ben Jonson</span> (<b>1574-1637</b>), the
greatest dramatist of England after Shakespeare, was born in Westminster
in the year 1574, just nine years after Shakespeare’s birth. He received
his education at Westminster School. It is said that, after leaving
school, he was obliged to assist his stepfather as a bricklayer; that he
did not like the work; and that he ran off to the Low Countries, and
there enlisted as a soldier. On his return to London, he began to write

the stage. Jonson was a friend and companion of Shakespeare’s; and at
the Mermaid, in Fleet Street, they had, in presence of men like Raleigh,
Marlowe, Greene, Peele, and other distinguished Englishmen, many
“wit-combats” together. Jonson’s greatest plays are <b>Volpone</b> or
the Fox, and the <b>Alchemist</b>&mdash;both comedies. In 1616 he was
created Poet-Laureate. For many years he was in receipt of a pension
from James&nbsp;I. and from Charles&nbsp;I.; but so careless and profuse
were his habits, that he died in poverty in the year 1637. He was buried
in an upright position in Westminster Abbey; and the stone over his
grave still bears the inscription, “O&nbsp;rare Ben Jonson!” He has been
called a “robust, surly, and observing dramatist.”</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Richard Hooker</span> (<b>1553-1600</b>), one
of the greatest of Elizabethan prose-writers, was born at Heavitree,
a&nbsp;village near the city of Exeter, in the year 1553. By the kind
aid of Jewel, Bishop of Salisbury, he was sent to Oxford, where he
distinguished himself as a hard-working student, and especially for his
knowledge of Hebrew. In 1581 he entered the Church. In the same year he
made an imprudent marriage with an ignorant, coarse, vulgar, and
domineering woman. He was appointed Master of the Temple in 1585; but,
by his own request, he was removed from that office, and chose the
quieter living of Boscombe, near Salisbury. Here he wrote the first four
books of his famous work, <b>The Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity</b>,
which were published in the year 1594. In 1595 he was translated to the
living of Bishopsborne, near Canterbury. His death took place in the
year 1600. The complete work, which consisted of eight books, was not
published till 1662.</p>

<p class = "author">
<a name = "partIV_chapIV_sec17" id = "partIV_chapIV_sec17">17.</a>
<b>Hooker’s Style.</b>&mdash;His writings are said to “mark an era in
English prose.” His sentences are generally very long, very elaborate,
but full of “an extraordinary musical richness of language.” The order
is often more like that of a Latin than of an English sentence; and he
is fond of Latin inversions. Thus he writes: “That which by wisdom he
saw to be requisite for that people, was by as great wisdom compassed.”
The following sentences give us a good example of his sweet and musical
rhythm. “Of law there can be no less acknowledged, than that her seat is
the bosom of God, her voice the harmony of the world. All things in
heaven and earth do her homage; the very least as feeling her care, and
the greatest as not exempted from her power: both angels and men, and
creatures of what condition soever, though each in different sort and
manner, yet all, with uniform consent, admiring her as the mother of
their peace and joy.”</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Sir Philip Sidney</span> (<b>1554-1586</b>), a
noble knight, a&nbsp;statesman, and one of the best prose-writers of the
Elizabethan age, was born at Penshurst, in Kent, in the year 1554. He
was educated at Shrewsbury School, and then at Christ Church, Oxford. At
the age of seventeen he went abroad for three years’ travel on the
Continent; and, while in Paris, witnessed, from the windows of the
English Embassy, the horrible Massacre of St&nbsp;Bartholomew in the
year 1572. At the early age of twenty-two he was sent as ambassador to
the Emperor of Germany; and while on that embassy, he met William of
Orange&mdash;“William the Silent”&mdash;who pronounced him one of the
ripest statesmen in Europe. This was said of a young man “who seems to
have been the type of what was noblest in the youth of England during
times that could produce a statesman.” In 1580 he wrote the
<b>Arcadia</b>, a&nbsp;romance, and dedicated it to his sister, the
Countess of Pembroke. The year after, he produced his <b>Apologie for
Poetrie</b>. His policy as a statesman was to side with Protestant
rulers, and to break the power of the strongest Catholic kingdom on the
Continent&mdash;the power of Spain. In 1585 the Queen sent him to the
Netherlands as governor of the important fortress of Flushing. He was
mortally wounded in a skirmish at Zutphen; and as he was being carried
off the field, handed to a private the cup of cold water that had been
brought to quench his raging thirst. He died of his wounds on the 17th
of October 1586. One of his friends wrote of him:&mdash;</p>

<b>Sidney’s Poetry.</b>&mdash;In addition to the <b>Arcadia</b> and the
<b>Apologie for Poetrie</b>, Sidney wrote a number of beautiful poems.
The best of these are a series of sonnets called <b>Astrophel</b> and
<b>Stella</b>, of which his latest critic says: “As a series of sonnets,
the <b>Astrophel</b> and <b>Stella</b> poems are second only to
Shakespeare’s; as a series of love-poems, they are perhaps unsurpassed.”
Spenser wrote an elegy upon Sidney himself, under the title of
<b>Astrophel</b>. Sidney’s prose is among the best of the sixteenth
century. “He reads more modern than any other author of that century.”
He does not use “ink-horn terms,” or cram his sentences with Latin or
French or Italian words; but both his words and his idioms are of pure
English. He is fond of using personifications. Such phrases as, “About
the time that the candles began to inherit the sun’s office;” “Seeing
the day begin to disclose her comfortable beauties,” are not uncommon.
The rhythm of his sentences is always melodious, and each of them has a
very pleasant close.</p>

<b>The First Half.</b>&mdash;Under the wise and able rule of Queen
Elizabeth, this country had enjoyed a long term of peace. The Spanish
Armada had been defeated in 1588; the Spanish power had gradually waned
before the growing might of England; and it could be said with perfect
truth, in the words of Shakespeare:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“In her days every man doth eat in safety</p>
<p>Under his own vine what he plants, and sing</p>

<p>The country was at peace; and every peaceful art and pursuit
prospered. As one sign of the great prosperity and outstretching
enterprise of commerce, we should note the foundation of the East India
Company on the last day of the year 1600. The reign of James I.
(1603-1625) was also peaceful; and the country made steady progress in
industries, in commerce, and in the arts and sciences. The two greatest
prose-writers of the first half of the seventeenth century were
<b>Raleigh</b> and <b>Bacon</b>; the two greatest poets were
<b>Shakespeare</b> and <b>Ben Jonson</b>.</p>

(<b>1552-1618</b>).&mdash;<b>Walter Raleigh</b>, soldier, statesman,
coloniser, historian, and poet, was born in Devonshire, in the year
1552. He was sent to Oriel College, Oxford; but he left at the early age
of seventeen to fight on the side of the Protestants in France. From
that time his life is one long series of schemes, plots,
<span class = "pagenum">299</span>

adventures, and misfortunes&mdash;culminating in his execution at
Westminster in the year 1618. He spent “the evening of a tempestuous
life” in the Tower, where he lay for thirteen years; and during this
imprisonment he wrote his greatest work, the <b>History of the
World</b>, which was never finished. His life and adventures belong to
the sixteenth; his works to the seventeenth century. Raleigh was
probably the most dazzling figure of his time; and is “in a singular
degree the representative of the vigorous versatility of the Elizabethan
period.” Spenser, whose neighbour he was for some time in Ireland,
thought highly of his poetry, calls him “the summer’s nightingale,” and
says of him&mdash;</p>

noble, and melodious. The following is the last sentence of the

in the Strand, London, in the year 1561. He was a grave and precocious
child; and Queen Elizabeth, who knew him and liked him, used to pat him
and call him her “young Lord Keeper”&mdash;his father being Lord Keeper
of the Seals in her reign. At the early age of twelve he was sent to
Trinity College, Cambridge, and remained there for three years. In 1582
he was called to the bar; in 1593 he was M.P. for Middlesex. But his
greatest rise in fortune did not take place till the reign of
James&nbsp;I.; when, in the year 1618, he had risen to be Lord High
Chancellor of England. The title which he took on this
occasion&mdash;for the Lord High Chancellor is chairman of the House of
Lords&mdash;was <b>Baron Verulam</b>; and a few years after he was
created <b>Viscount St&nbsp;Albans</b>. His eloquence was famous in
England; and Ben Jonson said of him: “The fear of every man that heard
him was lest he should make an end.” In the year 1621 he was accused of
taking bribes, and of giving unjust decisions as a judge. He had not
really been unconscientious, but he had been careless; was obliged to
plead guilty; and he was sentenced to pay a fine of £40,000, and to be
imprisoned in the Tower during the king’s pleasure. The fine was
remitted; Bacon was set free in two days; a&nbsp;pension was allowed
him; but he never afterwards held office of any kind. He died on
Easter-day of the year 1626, of a chill which he caught while
experimenting on the preservative properties of snow.</p>

His chief prose-works in English&mdash;for he wrote many in
Latin&mdash;are the <b>Essays</b>, and the <b>Advancement of
Learning</b>. His <b>Essays</b> make one of the wisest books ever
written; and a great number of English thinkers owe to them the best of
what they have had to say. They are written in a clear, forcible, pithy,
and picturesque style, with short sentences, and a good many
illustrations, drawn from history, politics, and science. It is true
that the style is sometimes stiff, and even rigid; but the stiffness is
the stiffness of a richly embroidered cloth, into which threads of gold
and silver have been worked. Bacon kept what he called a <b>Promus</b>
or Commonplace-Book; and in this he entered striking thoughts,
sentences, and phrases that he met with in the course of his reading, or
that occurred to him during the day. He calls these sentences
“salt-pits, that you may extract salt out of, and sprinkle as you will.”

<span class = "smallcaps">William Shakespeare</span> (<b>1564-1616</b>)
has been already treated of in the chapter on the sixteenth century. But
it may be noted here that his first two periods&mdash;as they are
called&mdash;fall within the sixteenth, and his last two periods within
the seventeenth century. His first period lies between 1591 and 1596;
and to it are ascribed his early poems, his play of <b>Richard II.</b>,
and some other historical plays. His second period, which stretches from
1596 to 1601 holds the Sonnets, the <b>Merchant of Venice</b>, the
<b>Merry Wives of Windsor</b>, and a few historical dramas. But his
third and fourth periods were richer in production, and in greater
productions. The third period, which belongs to the years 1601 to 1608,
produced the play of <b>Julius Cæsar</b>, the great tragedies of
<b>Hamlet</b>, <b>Othello</b>, <b>Lear</b>, <b>Macbeth</b>, and some
others. To the fourth period, which lies between 1608 and 1613, belong
the calmer and wiser dramas,&mdash;<b>Winter’s Tale</b>, <b>The

<b>The Second Half.</b>&mdash;The second half of the great and unique
seventeenth century was of a character very different indeed from that
of the first half. The Englishmen born into it had to face a new world!
New thoughts in religion, new forces in politics, new powers in social
matters had been slowly, steadily, and irresistibly rising into
supremacy ever since the Scottish King James came to take his seat upon
the throne of England in 1603. These new forces had, in fact, become so
<span class = "pagenum">302</span>
<!--png 120-->
strong that they led a king to the scaffold, and handed over the
government of England to a section of Republicans. Charles I. was
executed in 1649; and, though his son came back to the throne in 1660,
the face, the manners, the thoughts of England and of Englishmen had
undergone a complete internal and external change. The Puritan party was
everywhere the ruling party; and its views and convictions, in religion,
in politics, and in literature, held unquestioned sway in almost every
part of England. In the Puritan party, the strongest section was formed
by the Independents&mdash;the “root and branch men”&mdash;as they were
called; and the greatest man among the Independents was Oliver Cromwell,
in whose government <b>John Milton</b> was Foreign Secretary. Milton was
certainly by far the greatest and most powerful writer, both in prose
and in verse, on the side of the Puritan party. The ablest verse-writer
on the Royalist or Court side was <b>Samuel Butler</b>, the unrivalled
satirist&mdash;the Hogarth of language,&mdash;the author of
<b>Hudibras</b>. The greatest prose-writer on the Royalist and Church
side was <b>Jeremy Taylor</b>, Bishop of Down, in Ireland, and the
author of <b>Holy Living</b>, <b>Holy Dying</b>, and many other works
written with a wonderful eloquence. The greatest philosophical writer
was <b>Thomas Hobbes</b>, the author of the <b>Leviathan</b>. The most
powerful writer for the people was <b>John Bunyan</b>, the immortal
author of <b>The Pilgrim’s Progress</b>. When, however, we come to the
reigns of Charles II. and James II., and the new influences which their
rule and presence imparted, we find the greatest poet to be <b>John
Dryden</b>, and the most important prose-writer, <b>John Locke</b>.</p>

<p><a name = "partIV_chapV_sec7" id = "partIV_chapV_sec7">7.</a>
<b>The Poetry of the Second Half.</b>&mdash;The poetry of the second
half of the seventeenth century was not an outgrowth or lineal
descendant of the poetry of the first half. No trace of the strong
Elizabethan poetical emotion remained; no writer of this half-century
can claim kinship with the great authors of the Elizabethan period. The
three most remarkable poets in the latter half of this century are
<b>John Milton</b>, <b>Samuel Butler</b>, and <b>John Dryden</b>. But
Milton’s culture was derived chiefly from the great Greek and Latin
writers; and his poems show
<span class = "pagenum">303</span>
<!--png 121-->
few or no signs of belonging to any age or generation in particular of
English literature. Butler’s poem, the <b>Hudibras</b>, is the only one
of its kind; and if its author owes anything to other writers, it is to
France and not to England that we must look for its sources. Dryden,
again, shows no sign of being related to Shakespeare or the dramatic
writers of the early part of the century; he is separated from them by a
great gulf; he owes most, when he owes anything, to the French school of
poetry.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">John Milton</span> (<b>1608-1674</b>), the
second greatest name in English poetry, and the greatest of all our epic
poets, was born in Bread Street, Cheapside, London, in the year
1608&mdash;five years after the accession of James&nbsp;I. to the
throne, and eight years before the death of Shakespeare. He was educated
at St&nbsp;Paul’s School, and then at Christ’s College, Cambridge. He
was so handsome&mdash;with a delicate complexion, clear blue eyes, and
light-brown hair flowing down his shoulders&mdash;that he was known as
the “Lady of Christ’s.” He was destined for the Church; but, being early
seized with a strong desire to compose a great poetical work which
should bring honour to his country and to the English tongue, he gave up
all idea of becoming a clergyman. Filled with his secret purpose, he
retired to Horton, in Buckinghamshire, where his father had bought a
small country seat. Between the years 1632 and 1638 he studied all the
best Greek and Latin authors, mathematics, and science; and he also
wrote <b>L’Allegro</b> and <b>Il&nbsp;Penseroso</b>, <b>Comus</b>,
<b>Lycidas</b>, and some shorter poems. These were preludes, or
exercises, towards the great poetical work which it was the mission of
his life to produce. In 1638-39 he took a journey to the Continent. Most
of his time was spent in Italy; and, when in Florence, he paid a visit
to Galileo in prison. It had been his intention to go on to Greece; but
the troubled state of politics at home brought him back sooner than he
wished. The next ten years of his life were engaged in teaching and in
writing his prose works. His ideas on teaching are to be found in his
<b>Tractate on Education</b>. The most eloquent of his prose-works is
his <b>Areopagitica, a&nbsp;Speech for the Liberty of Unlicensed
Printing</b> (1644)&mdash;a&nbsp;plea for the freedom of the press, for
relieving all writings from the criticism of censors. In 1649&mdash;the
year of the execution of Charles&nbsp;I.&mdash;Milton was appointed
Latin or Foreign Secretary to the Government of Oliver Cromwell; and for
the next ten years his time was taken up with official work, and with
writing prose-volumes in defence of the action of the
<span class = "pagenum">304</span>

Republic. In 1660 the Restoration took place; and Milton was at length
free, in his fifty-third year, to carry out his long-cherished scheme of
writing a great Epic poem. He chose the subject of the fall and the
restoration of man. <b>Paradise Lost</b> was completed in 1665; but,
owing to the Plague and the Fire of London, it was not published till
the year 1667. Milton’s young Quaker friend, Ellwood, said to him one
day: “Thou hast said much of Paradise Lost, what hast thou to say of
Paradise Found?” <b>Paradise Regained</b> was the
result&mdash;a&nbsp;work which was written in 1666, and appeared, along
with <b>Samson Agonistes</b>, in the year 1671. Milton died in the year
1674&mdash;about the middle of the reign of Charles II. He had been
three times married.</p>

<b>L’Allegro</b> (or “The Cheerful Man”) is a companion poem to <b>Il
Penseroso</b> (or&nbsp;“The Meditative Man”). The poems present two
contrasted views of the life of the student. They are written in an
irregular kind of octosyllabic verse. The <b>Comus</b>&mdash;mostly in
blank verse&mdash;is a lyrical drama; and Milton’s work was accompanied
by a musical composition by the then famous musician Henry Lawes.
<b>Lycidas</b>&mdash;a&nbsp;poem in irregular rhymed verse&mdash;is a
threnody on the death of Milton’s young friend, Edward King, who was
drowned in sailing from Chester to Dublin. This poem has been called
“the touchstone of taste;” the man who cannot admire it has no feeling
for true poetry. The <b>Paradise Lost</b> is the story of how Satan was
allowed to plot against the happiness of man; and how Adam and Eve fell
through his designs. The style is the noblest in the English language;
the music of the rhythm is lofty, involved, sustained, and sublime. “In
reading ‘Paradise Lost,’” says Mr&nbsp;Lowell, “one has a feeling of
spaciousness such as no other poet gives.” <b>Paradise Regained</b> is,
in fact, the story of the Temptation, and of Christ’s triumph over the
wiles of Satan. Wordsworth says: “‘Paradise Regained’ is most perfect in
execution of any written by Milton;” and Coleridge remarks that “it is
in its kind the most perfect poem extant, though its kind may be
inferior in interest.” <b>Samson Agonistes</b> (“Samson in Struggle”) is
a drama, in highly irregular unrhymed verse, in which the poet sets
forth his own unhappy fate&mdash;</p>

after the birth of Milton, and four years before the death of
Shakespeare. He was educated at the grammar-school of Worcester, and
afterwards at Cambridge&mdash;but only for a short time. At the
Restoration he was made secretary to the Earl of Carbery, who was then
President of the Principality of Wales, and steward of Ludlow Castle.
The first part of his long poem called <b>Hudibras</b> appeared in 1662;
the second part in 1663; the third in 1678. Two years after, Butler died
in the greatest poverty in London. He was buried in St&nbsp;Paul’s,
Covent Garden; but a monument was erected to him in Westminster Abbey.
Upon this fact Wesley wrote the following epigram:&mdash;</p>

The <b>Hudibras</b> is a burlesque poem,&mdash;a long lampoon,
a&nbsp;laboured caricature,&mdash;in mockery of the weaker side of the
great Puritan party. It is an imaginary account of the adventures of a
Puritan knight and his squire in the Civil Wars. It is choke-full of all
kinds of learning, of the most pungent remarks&mdash;a&nbsp;very hoard
of sentences and saws, “of vigorous locutions and picturesque phrases,
of strong, sound sense, and robust English.” It has been more quoted
from than almost any book in our language. Charles II. was never tired

greatest of our poets in the second rank, was born at Aldwincle, in
Northamptonshire, in the

year 1631. He was descended from Puritan ancestors on both sides of his
house. He was educated at Westminster School, and at Trinity College,
Cambridge. London became his settled abode in the year 1657. At the
Restoration, in 1660, he became an ardent Royalist; and, in the year
1663, he married the daughter of a Royalist nobleman, the Earl of
Berkshire. It was not a happy marriage; the lady, on the one hand, had a
violent temper, and, on the other, did not care a straw for the literary
pursuits of her husband. In 1666 he wrote his first long poem, the
<b>Annus Mirabilis</b> (“The Wonderful Year”), in which he paints the
war with Holland, and the Fire of London; and from this date his life is
“one long literary labour.” In 1670, he received the double appointment
of Historiographer-Royal and Poet-Laureate. Up to the year 1681, his
work lay chiefly in writing plays for the theatre; and these plays were
written in rhymed verse, in imitation of the French plays; for, from the
date of the Restoration, French influence was paramount both in
literature and in fashion. But in this year he published the first part
of <b>Absalom and Achitophel</b>&mdash;one of the most powerful satires
in the language. In the year 1683 he was appointed Collector of Customs
in the port of London&mdash;a&nbsp;post which Chaucer had held before
him. (It&nbsp;is worthy of note that Dryden “translated” the Tales of
Chaucer into modern English.) At the accession of James&nbsp;II., in
1685, Dryden became a Roman Catholic; most certainly neither for gain
nor out of gratitude, but from conviction. In 1687, appeared his poem of
<b>The Hind and the Panther</b>, in which he defends his new creed. He
had, a&nbsp;few years before, brought out another poem called <b>Religio
Laici</b> (“A&nbsp;Layman’s Faith”), which was a defence of the Church
of England and of her position in religion. In <b>The Hind and the
Panther</b>, the Hind represents the Roman Catholic Church,
“a&nbsp;milk-white hind, unspotted and unchanged,” the Panther the
Church of England; and the two beasts reply to each other in all the
arguments used by controversialists on these two sides. When the
Revolution of 1688 took place, and James&nbsp;II. had to flee the
kingdom, Dryden lost both his offices and the pension he had from the
Crown. Nothing daunted, he set to work once more. Again he wrote for the
stage; but the last years of his life were spent chiefly in translation.
He translated passages from Homer, Ovid, and from some Italian writers;
but his most important work was the translation of the whole of Virgil’s
<b>Æneid</b>. To the last he retained his fire and vigour, action and
rush of verse; and some of his greatest lyric poems belong to his later
years. His ode called <b>Alexander’s Feast</b> was written at the age of
sixty-six; and it was written at one sitting. At the age of sixty-nine
he was meditating a
<span class = "pagenum">307</span>

He died at his house in London, on May-day of 1700, and was buried with
great pomp and splendour in Poets’ Corner in Westminster Abbey.</p>

His best satire is the <b>Absalom and Achitophel</b>; his best specimen
of reasoning in verse is <b>The Hind and the Panther</b>. His best ode
is his <b>Ode to the Memory of Mrs&nbsp;Anne Killigrew</b>. Dryden’s
style is distinguished by its power, sweep, vigour, and “long majestic
march.” No one has handled the heroic couplet&mdash;and it was this form
of verse that he chiefly used&mdash;with more vigour than Dryden; Pope
was more correct, more sparkling, more finished, but he had not Dryden’s
magnificent march or sweeping impulsiveness. “The fire and spirit of the
‘Annus Mirabilis,’” says his latest critic, “are nothing short of
amazing, when the difficulties which beset the author are remembered.
The glorious dash of the performance is his own.” His prose, though full
of faults, is also very vigorous. It has “something of the lightning
zigzag vigour and splendour of his verse.” He always writes clear,
homely, and pure English,&mdash;full of force and point.</p>

His style is rich, even to luxury, full of the most imaginative
illustrations, and often overloaded with ornament. He has been called
“the Shakespeare of English prose,” “the Spenser of divinity,” and by
other appellations. The latter title is a very happy description; for he
has the same wealth of style, phrase, and description that Spenser has,
and the same boundless delight in setting forth his thoughts in a

“the greatest master of allegory that ever lived.” His power of
imagination is something wonderful; and his simple, homely, and vigorous
style makes everything so real, that we seem to be reading a narrative

said, “the vocabulary of the common people;” rather should we say that
his English is the English of the Bible and of the best religious
writers. His style is, almost everywhere, simple, homely, earnest, and
vernacular&mdash;without being vulgar. Bunyan’s books have, along with
Shakespeare and Tyndale’s works, been among the chief supports of an
idiomatic, nervous, and simple English.</p>

work, occupied his time and thoughts for eighteen years. In both these
books, Locke exhibits the very genius of common-sense. The purpose of
education is, in his opinion, not to make learned men, but to maintain
“a sound mind in a sound body;” and he begins the education of the
future man even from his cradle. In his philosophical writings, he is
always simple; but, as he is loose and vacillating in his use of terms,
this simplicity is often purchased at the expense of exactness and

CHAPTER VI.</a></h4>

<h6>THE FIRST HALF OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.</h6>


<p><a name = "partIV_chapVI_sec1" id = "partIV_chapVI_sec1">1.</a>
<b>The Age of Prose.</b>&mdash;The eighteenth century was an age of
prose in two senses. In the first place, it was a prosaic age; and, in
the second place, better prose than poetry was produced by its writers.
One remarkable fact may also be noted about the chief prose-writers of
this century&mdash;and that is, that they were, most of them, not merely
able writers, not merely distinguished literary men, but also men of
affairs&mdash;men well versed in the world and in matters of the highest
practical moment, while some were also statesmen holding high office.
Thus, in the first half of the century, we find Addison, Swift, and
Defoe either holding office or influencing and guiding those who held
office; while, in the latter half, we have men like Burke, Hume, and
Gibbon, of whom the same, or nearly the same, can be said. The poets, on
the contrary, of this eighteenth century, are all of them&mdash;with the
very slightest exceptions&mdash;men who devoted most of their lives to
poetry, and had little or nothing to do with practical matters. It may
also be noted here that the character of the eighteenth century becomes
more and more prosaic as it goes on&mdash;less and less under the
influence of the spirit of poetry, until, about the close, a&nbsp;great
reaction makes itself felt in the persons of Cowper, Chatterton, and
Burns, of Crabbe and Wordsworth.</p>

<p><a name = "partIV_chapVI_sec2" id = "partIV_chapVI_sec2">2.</a>
<b>The First Half.</b>&mdash;The great prose-writers of the first half
of the eighteenth century are <b>Addison</b> and <b>Steele</b>,
<b>Swift</b> and
<span class = "pagenum">312</span>
<!--png 130-->
<b>Defoe</b>. All of these men had some more or less close connection
with the rise of journalism in England; and one of them, Defoe, was
indeed the founder of the modern newspaper. By far the most powerful
intellect of these four was Swift. The greatest poets of the first half
of the eighteenth century were <b>Pope</b>, <b>Thomson</b>,
<b>Collins</b>, and <b>Gray</b>. Pope towers above all of them by a head
and shoulders, because he was much more fertile than any, and because he
worked so hard and so untiringly at the labour of the file&mdash;at the
task of polishing and improving his verses. But the vein of poetry in
the three others&mdash;and more especially in Collins&mdash;was much
more pure and genuine than it was in Pope at any time of his
life&mdash;at any period of his writing. Let us look at each of these
writers a little more closely.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Daniel Defoe</span> (<b>1661-1731</b>), one of
the most fertile writers that England ever saw, and one who has been the
delight of many generations of readers, was born in the city of London
in the year 1661. He was educated to be a Dissenting minister; but he
turned from that profession to the pursuit of trade. He attempted
several trades,&mdash;was a hosier, a&nbsp;hatter, a&nbsp;printer; and
he is said also to have been a brick and tile maker. In 1692 he failed
in business; but, in no long time after, he paid every one of his
creditors to the uttermost farthing. Through all his labours and
misfortunes he was always a hard and careful reader,&mdash;an omnivorous
reader, too, for he was in the habit of reading almost every book that
came in his way. He made his first reputation by writing political
pamphlets. One of his pamphlets brought him into high favour with King
William; another had the effect of placing him in the pillory and
lodging him in prison. But while in Newgate, he did not idle away his
time or “languish”; he set to work, wrote hard, and started a newspaper,
<b>The Review</b>,&mdash;the earliest genuine newspaper England had seen
up to his time. This paper he brought out two or three times a-week; and
every word of it he wrote himself. He continued to carry it on
single-handed for eight years. In 1706, he was made a member of the
Commission for bringing about the union between England and Scotland;
and his great knowledge of commerce and commercial affairs were of
singular value to this Commission. In 1715 he had a dangerous illness,
brought on by political excitement; and, on his recovery, he gave up
most of his political
<span class = "pagenum">313</span>
<!--png 131-->
writing, and took to the composition of stories and romances. Although
now a man of fifty-four, he wrote with the vigour and ease of a young
man of thirty. His greatest imaginative work was written in
1719&mdash;when he was nearly sixty&mdash;<b>The Life and Strange
Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, of York, Mariner,... written
by Himself</b>. Within six years he had produced twelve works of a
similar kind. He is said to have written in all two hundred and fifty
books in the course of his lifetime. He died in 1731.</p>

<p class = "author">
<a name = "partIV_chapVI_sec4" id = "partIV_chapVI_sec4">4.</a>
His best known&mdash;and it is also his greatest&mdash;work is
<b>Robinson Crusoe</b>; and this book, which every one has read, may be
compared with ‘Gulliver’s Travels,’ for the purpose of observing how
imaginative effects are produced by different means and in different
ways. Another vigorous work of imagination by Defoe is the <b>Journal of
the Plague</b>, which appeared in 1722. There are three chief things to
be noted regarding Defoe and his writings. These are: first, that Defoe
possessed an unparalleled knowledge&mdash;a&nbsp;knowledge wider than
even Shakespeare’s&mdash;of the circumstances and details of human life
among all sorts, ranks, and conditions of men; secondly, that he gains
his wonderful realistic effects by the freest and most copious use of
this detailed knowledge in his works of imagination; and thirdly, that
he possessed a vocabulary of the most wonderful wealth. His style is
strong, homely, and vigorous, but the sentences are long, loose, clumsy,
and sometimes ungrammatical. Like Sir Walter Scott, he was too eager to
produce large and broad effects to take time to balance his clauses or
to polish his sentences. Like Sir Walter Scott, again, he possesses in
the highest degree the art of <i>particularising</i>.</p>

examination, and, on a second trial, only obtained his B.A. “by special
favour.” He next came to England, and for eleven years acted as private
secretary to Sir William Temple, a&nbsp;retired statesman and
ambassador, who lived at Moor Park, near Richmond-on-Thames.
<span class = "pagenum">314</span>
<!--png 132-->
In 1692 he paid a visit to Oxford, and there obtained the degree of M.A.
In 1700 he went to Ireland with Lord Berkeley as his chaplain, and while
in that country was presented with several livings. He at first attached
himself to the Whig party, but stung by this party’s neglect of his
labours and merits, he joined the Tories, who raised him to the Deanery
of St&nbsp;Patrick’s Cathedral in Dublin. But, though nominally resident
in Dublin, he spent a large part of his time in London. Here he knew and
met everybody who was worth knowing, and for some time he was the most
imposing figure, and wielded the greatest influence in all the best
social, political, and literary circles of the capital. In 1714, on the
death of Queen Anne, Swift’s hopes of further advancement died out; and
he returned to his Deanery, settled in Dublin, and “commenced Irishman
for life.” A&nbsp;man of strong passions, he usually spent his birthday
in reading that chapter of the Book of Job which contains the verse,
“Let the day perish in which I was born.” He died insane in 1745, and
left his fortune to found a lunatic asylum in Dublin. One day, when
taking a walk with a friend, he saw a blasted elm, and, pointing to it,
he said: “I&nbsp;shall be like that tree, and die first at the top.” For
the last three years of his life he never spoke one word.</p>

Swift has written verse; but it is his prose-works that give him his
high and unrivalled place in English literature. His most powerful work,
published in 1704, is the <b>Tale of a Tub</b>&mdash;a&nbsp;satire on
the disputes between the Roman Catholic, Anglican, and Presbyterian
Churches. His best known prose-work is the <b>Gulliver’s Travels</b>,
which appeared in 1726. This work is also a satire; but it is a satire
on men and women,&mdash;on humanity. “The power of Swift’s prose,” it
has been said by an able critic, “was the terror of his own, and remains
the wonder of after times.” His style is strong, simple,
straightforward; he uses the plainest words and the homeliest English,
and every blow tells. Swift’s style&mdash;as every genuine style
does&mdash;reflects the author’s character. He was an ardent lover and a
good hater. Sir Walter Scott describes him as “tall, strong, and well
made, dark in complexion, but with bright blue eyes (Pope said they were
“as azure as the heavens”), black and bushy eyebrows, aquiline nose, and
features which expressed the stern, haughty, and dauntless turn of his
mind.” He grew savage under the slightest contradiction; and dukes and
great lords were obliged to pay court to him. His prose was as trenchant
and powerful as were his manners: it has been compared to “cold steel.”
His own definition of a good style is “proper words in proper
places.”</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Joseph Addison</span> (<b>1672-1719</b>), the
most elegant prose-writer&mdash;as Pope was the <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘mose’">most</ins> polished
verse-writer&mdash;of the eighteenth century, was born at Milston, in
Wiltshire, in the year 1672. He was educated at Charterhouse School, in
London, where one of his friends and companions was the celebrated Dick
Steele&mdash;afterwards Sir Richard Steele. He then went to Oxford,
where he made a name for himself by his beautiful compositions in Latin
verse. In 1695 he addressed a poem to King William; and this poem
brought him into notice with the Government of the day. Not long after,
he received a pension of £300 a-year, to enable him to travel; and he
spent some time in France and Italy. The chief result of this tour was a
poem entitled <b>A Letter from Italy</b> to Lord Halifax. In 1704, when
Lord Godolphin was in search of a poet who should celebrate in an
adequate style the striking victory of Blenheim, Addison was introduced
to him by Lord Halifax. His poem called <b>The Campaign</b> was the
result; and one simile in it took and held the attention of all English
readers, and of “the town.” A&nbsp;violent storm had passed over
England; and Addison compared the calm genius of Marlborough, who was as
cool and serene amid shot and shell as in a drawing-room or at the
dinner-table, to the Angel of the Storm. The lines are these:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“So when an Angel by divine command</p>
<p>With rising tempests shakes a guilty land,</p>
<p>Such as of late o’er pale Britannia passed,</p>
<p>Calm and serene he drives the furious blast;</p>
<p>And, pleased the Almighty’s orders to perform,</p>
<p>Rides in the whirlwind, and directs the storm.”</p>
</div>

<p class = "author">
For this poem Addison was rewarded with the post of Commissioner of
Appeals. He rose, successively, to be Under Secretary of State;
Secretary for Ireland; and, finally, Secretary of State for
England&mdash;an office which would correspond to that of our present
Home Secretary. He married the Countess of Warwick, to whose son he had
been tutor; but it was not a happy marriage. Pope says of him in regard
to it, that&mdash;</p>

<p class = "poem">
“He married discord in a noble wife.”</p>

But it is not at all as a poet, but as a prose-writer, that Addison is
famous in the history of literature. While he was in Ireland, his friend
Steele started <b>The Tatler</b>, in 1709; and Addison sent numerous
contributions to this little paper. In 1711, Steele began a still more
famous paper, which he called <b>The Spectator</b>; and
<span class = "pagenum">316</span>
<!--png 134-->
Addison’s writings in this morning journal made its reputation. His
contributions are distinguishable by being signed with some one of the
letters of the name <i>Clio</i>&mdash;the Muse of History. A&nbsp;third
paper, <b>The Guardian</b>, appeared a few years after; and Addison’s
contributions to it are designated by a hand (-->) at the foot
of each. In addition to his numerous prose-writings, Addison brought out
the tragedy of <b>Cato</b> in 1713. It was very successful; but it is
now neither read nor acted. Some of his hymns, however, are beautiful,
and are well known. Such are the hymn beginning, “The spacious firmament
on high;” and his version of the 23d Psalm, “The Lord my pasture shall
prepare.”</p>

<p class = "author">

Addison’s prose style is inimitable, easy, graceful, full of
humour&mdash;full of good humour, delicate, with a sweet and kindly
rhythm, and always musical to the ear. He is the most graceful of social
satirists; and his genial creation of the character of <b>Sir Roger de
Coverley</b> will live for ever. While his work in verse is never more
than second-rate, his writings in prose are always first-rate.
Dr&nbsp;Johnson said of his prose: “Whoever wishes to attain an English
style&mdash;familiar but not coarse, and elegant but not
ostentatious,&mdash;must give his days and nights to the study of
Addison.” Lord Lytton also remarks: “His style has that nameless
urbanity in which we recognise the perfection of manner; courteous, but
not courtier-like; so dignified, yet so kindly; so easy, yet high-bred.
It is the most perfect form of English.” His style, however, must be
acknowledged to want force&mdash;to be easy rather than vigorous; and it
has not the splendid march of Jeremy Taylor, or the noble power of
Savage Landor.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Richard Steele</span> (<b>1671-1729</b>),
commonly called “Dick Steele,” the friend and colleague of Addison, was
born in Dublin, but of English parents, in the year 1671. The two
friends were educated at Charterhouse and at Oxford together; and they
remained friends, with some slight breaks and breezes, to the close of
life. Steele was a writer of plays, essays, and pamphlets&mdash;for one
of which he was expelled from the House of Commons; but his chief fame
was earned in connection with the Society Journals, which he founded. He
started many&mdash;such as <b>Town-Talk</b>, <b>The Tea-Table</b>,
<b>Chit-Chat</b>; but only the <b>Tatler</b> and the <b>Spectator</b>
rose to success and to fame. The strongest quality in his writing is his
pathos: the source of tears is always at his command; and, although
himself of a gay and even rollicking temperament, he seems to have
preferred this vein. The literary skill of Addison&mdash;his happy art
in

<span class = "smallcaps">Alexander Pope</span> (<b>1688-1744</b>), the
greatest poet of the eighteenth century, was born in Lombard Street,
London, in the year of the Revolution, 1688. His father was a wholesale
linendraper, who, having amassed a fortune, retired to Binfield, on the
borders of Windsor Forest. In the heart of this beautiful country young
Pope’s youth was spent. On the death of his father, Pope left Windsor
and took up his residence at Twickenham, on the banks of the Thames,
where he remained till his death in 1744. His parents being Roman
Catholics, it was impossible for young Pope to go either to a public
school or to one of the universities; and hence he was educated
privately. At the early age of eight, he met with a translation of Homer
in verse; and this volume became his companion night and day. At the age
of ten, he turned some of the events described in Homer into a play. The
poems of Spenser, the poets’ poet, were his next favourites; but the
writer who made the deepest and most lasting impression upon his mind
was Dryden. Little Pope began to write verse very early. He says of
himself&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“As yet a child, nor yet a fool to fame,</p>
<p>I lisped in numbers, for the numbers came.”</p>
</div>

<p class = "author">
His <b>Ode to Solitude</b> was written at the age of twelve; his
<b>Pastorals</b> when he was fifteen. His <b>Essay on Criticism</b>,
which was composed in his twentieth year, though not published till
1711, established his reputation as a writer of neat, clear, sparkling,
and elegant verse. The <b>Rape of the Lock</b> raised his reputation
still higher. Macaulay pronounced it his best poem. De Quincey declared
it to be “the most exquisite monument of playful fancy that universal
literature offers.” Another critic has called it the “perfection of the
mock-heroic.” Pope’s most successful poem&mdash;if we measure it by the
fame and the money it brought him&mdash;was his translation of the
<b>Iliad</b> of Homer. A&nbsp;great scholar said of this translation
that it was “a very pretty poem, but not Homer.” The fact is that Pope
did not translate directly from the Greek, but from a French or a Latin
version which he kept beside him. Whatever its faults, and however great
its deficiency as a representation of the powerful and deep simplicity
of the original Greek, no one can deny the charm and finish of its
versification, or the rapidity, facility, and melody of the flow of the
verse. These qualities make this work unique in English poetry.</p>

After finishing the <b>Iliad</b>, Pope undertook a translation of the
<b>Odyssey</b> of Homer. This was not so successful; nor was it so well
done. In fact, Pope translated only half of it himself; the other half
was written by two scholars called Broome and Fenton. His next great
poem was the <b>Dunciad</b>,&mdash;a&nbsp;satire upon those petty
writers, carping critics, and hired defamers who had tried to write down
the reputation of Pope’s Homeric work. “The composition of the ‘Dunciad’
revealed to Pope where his true strength lay, in blending personalities
with moral reflections.”</p>

<p class = "author">

Pope’s greatest works were written between 1730 and 1740; and they
consist of the <b>Moral Essays</b>, the <b>Essay on Man</b>, and the
<b>Epistles and Satires</b>. These poems are full of the finest
thoughts, expressed in the most perfect form. Mr&nbsp;Ruskin quotes the
couplet&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“Never elated, while one man’s oppressed;</p>
<p>Never dejected, whilst another’s blessed,”&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p class = "author">
as “the most complete, concise, and lofty expression of moral temper
existing in English words.” The poem of Pope which shows his best and
most striking qualities in their most characteristic form, is probably
the <b>Epistle to Dr&nbsp;Arbuthnot</b> or <b>Prologue to the
Satires</b>. In this poem occur the celebrated lines about
Addison&mdash;which make a perfect portrait, although it is far from
being a true likeness.</p>

Pope is the foremost literary figure of his age and century; and he is
also the head of a school. He brought to perfection a style of writing
verse which was followed by hundreds of clever writers. Cowper says of
him:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“But Pope&mdash;his musical finesse was such,</p>
<p>So nice his ear, so delicate his touch,&mdash;</p>

Pope was not the poet of nature or of humanity; he was the poet of “the
town,” and of the Court. He was greatly influenced by the neatness and
polish of French verse; and, from his boyhood, his great ambition was to
be “a correct poet.” He worked and worked, polished and polished, until
each idea had received at his hands its very neatest and most
epigrammatic expression. In the art of condensed, compact, pointed, and
yet harmonious and flowing verse, Pope has no equal. But, as a vehicle
for poetry&mdash;for the love and sympathy with nature and man which
every true poet must feel, Pope’s verse is artificial; and its style of
expression has now died out. It was one of the chief missions of
Wordsworth to drive the Popian second-hand vocabulary out of
existence.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">James Thomson</span> (<b>1700-1748</b>), the
poet of <b>The Seasons</b>, was born at Ednam in Roxburghshire,
Scotland, in the year 1700. He was educated at the grammar-school of
Jedburgh, and then at the University of Edinburgh. It was intended that
he should enter the ministry of the Church of Scotland; but, before his
college course was finished, he had given up this idea: poetry proved
for him too strong a magnet. While yet a young man, he had written his
poem of <b>Winter</b>; and, with that in his pocket, he resolved to try
his fortune in London. While walking about the streets, looking at the
shops, and gazing at the new wonders of the vast metropolis, his pocket
was picked of his pocket-handkerchief and his letters of introduction;
and he found himself alone in London&mdash;thrown entirely on his own
resources. A&nbsp;publisher was, however, in time found for
<b>Winter</b>; and the poem slowly rose into appreciation and
popularity. This was in 1726. Next year, <b>Summer</b>; two years after,
<b>Spring</b> appeared; while <b>Autumn</b>, in 1730, completed the
<b>Seasons</b>. The <b>Castle of Indolence</b>&mdash;a&nbsp;poem in the
Spenserian stanza&mdash;appeared in 1748. In the same year he was
appointed Surveyor-General of the Leeward Islands, though he never
visited the scene of his duty, but had his work done by deputy. He died

Thomson’s place as a poet is high in the second rank. His <b>Seasons</b>
have always been popular; and, when Coleridge found a well-thumbed and
thickly dog’s-eared copy lying on the window-sill of a country inn, he
exclaimed “This is true fame!” His <b>Castle of Indolence</b> is,
however, a&nbsp;finer piece of poetical work than any of his other
writings. The first canto is the best. But the <b>Seasons</b> have been
much more widely read; and a modern critic says: “No poet has given the
special pleasure which poetry is capable of giving to so large a number
of persons in so large a measure as Thomson.” Thomson is very unequal in
his style. Sometimes he rises to a great height of inspired expression;
at other times he sinks to a dull dead level of pedestrian prose. His
power of describing scenery is often very remarkable. Professor Craik
says: “There is no other poet who surrounds us with so much of the truth
of nature;” and he calls the <b>Castle of Indolence</b> “one of the gems
of the language.”</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Thomas Gray</span> (<b>1716-1771</b>), the
greatest elegiac poet of the century, was born in London in 1716. His
father was a “money-scrivener,” as it was called; in other words, he was
a stock-broker. His mother’s brother was an assistant-master at Eton;
and at Eton, under the care of this uncle, Gray was brought up. One of
his schoolfellows was the famous Horace Walpole. After leaving school,
Gray proceeded to Cambridge; but, instead of reading mathematics, he
studied classical literature, history, and modern languages, and never
took his degree. After some years spent at Cambridge, he entered himself
<ins class = "correction" title = "text unchanged">of</ins> the Inner
Temple; but he never gave much time to the study of law. His father died
in 1741; and Gray, soon after, gave up the law and went to live entirely
at Cambridge. The first published of his poems was the <b>Ode on a
Distant Prospect of Eton College</b>. The <b>Elegy written in a Country
Churchyard</b> was handed about in manuscript before its publication in
1750; and it made his reputation at once. In 1755 the <b>Progress of
Poesy</b> was published; and the ode entitled <b>The Bard</b> was begun.
In 1768 he was appointed Professor of Modern History at Cambridge; but,
though he studied hard, he never lectured. He died at Cambridge, at the
age of fifty-four, in the year 1771. Gray was never married. He was said
by those who knew him to be the most learned man of his time in Europe.
Literature, history, and several sciences&mdash;all were thoroughly
known to him. He had read everything in the world that was best worth
reading; while his knowledge of botany, zoology, and entomology was both
wide and exact.</p>

Gray’s <b>Elegy</b> took him seven years to write; it contains
thirty-two stanzas; and Mr&nbsp;Palgrave says “they are perhaps the
noblest stanzas in the language.” General Wolfe, when sailing down to
attack Quebec, recited the Elegy to his officers, and declared, “Now,
gentlemen, I&nbsp;would rather be the author of that poem than take
Quebec.” Lord Byron called the Elegy “the corner-stone of Gray’s
poetry.” Gray ranks with Milton as the most finished workman in English
verse; and certainly he spared no pains. Gray said himself that “the
style he aimed at was extreme conciseness of expression, yet pure,
perspicuous, and musical;” and this style, at which he aimed, he
succeeded fully in achieving. One of the finest stanzas in the whole
Elegy is the last, which the writer omitted in all the later
editions:&mdash;</p>

of the truest lyrical poets of the century, was born at Chichester on
Christmas-day, 1721. He was educated at Winchester School; afterwards at
Queen’s, and also at Magdalen College, Oxford. Before he left school he
had written a set of poems called <b>Persian Eclogues</b>. He left the
university with a reputation for ability and for indolence; went to
London “with many projects in his head and little money in his pocket;”
and there found a kind and fast friend in Dr&nbsp;Johnson. His
<b>Odes</b> appeared in 1747. The volume fell stillborn from the press:
not a single copy was sold; no one bought, read, or noticed it. In a fit
of furious despair, the unhappy author called in the whole edition and
burnt every copy with his own hands. And yet it was, with the single
exception of the songs of Burns, the truest poetry that had appeared in
the whole of the eighteenth century. A&nbsp;great critic says: “In the
little book there was hardly a single false note: there was, above all
things, a&nbsp;purity of music, a&nbsp;clarity of style, to which I know
of no parallel in English verse from the death of Andrew Marvell to the
birth of William Blake.” Soon after this great disappointment he went to
live at Richmond, where he formed a friendship with Thomson and other

perhaps the narrowest, but assuredly the highest, of his generation. He
could not be taught singing like a finch, but he struck straight upward
for the sun like a lark.... The direct sincerity and purity of their
positive and straightforward inspiration will always keep his poems
fresh and sweet in the senses of all men. He was a solitary song-bird
among many more or less excellent pipers and pianists. He could put more
spirit of colour into a single stroke, more breath of music into a
single note, than could all the rest of his generation into all the
labours of their lives.”</p>

<b>Prose-Writers.</b>&mdash;The four greatest prose-writers of the
latter half of the eighteenth century are <b>Johnson</b>,
<b>Goldsmith</b>, <b>Burke</b>, and <b>Gibbon</b>. Dr&nbsp;Johnson was
the most prominent literary figure in London at this period; and filled
in his own time much the same position that Carlyle lately held in
literary circles. He wrote on many subjects&mdash;but chiefly on
literature and morals; and hence he was called “The Great Moralist.”
Goldsmith stands out clearly as the writer of the most pleasant and easy
prose; his pen was ready for any subject; and it has been said of him
with perfect truth, that he touched nothing that he did not adorn. Burke
was the most eloquent writer of his time, and by far the greatest
political thinker that England has ever produced. He is known by an
essay he wrote when a very young man&mdash;on “The Sublime and
Beautiful”; but it is to his speeches and political writings that we
must look for his noblest thoughts and most eloquent language. Gibbon is
one of the greatest historians and most powerful writers the world has
ever seen.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Samuel Johnson</span> (<b>1709-1784</b>), the
great essayist and lexicographer, was born at Lichfield in the year
1709. His father was a bookseller; and it was in his father’s shop that
Johnson acquired his habit of omnivorous reading, or rather devouring of
books. The mistress of the dame’s school, to which he first went,
declared him
<span class = "pagenum">324</span>
<!--png 142-->
to be the best scholar she ever had. After a few years at the free
grammar-school of Lichfield, and one year at Stourbridge, he went to
Pembroke College, Oxford, at the age of nineteen. Here he did not
confine himself to the studies of the place, but indulged in a wide
range of miscellaneous reading. He was too poor to take a degree, and
accordingly left Oxford without graduating. After acting for some time
as a bookseller’s hack, he married a Mrs&nbsp;Porter of
Birmingham&mdash;a&nbsp;widow with £800. With this money he opened a
boarding-school, or “academy” as he called it; but he had never more
than three scholars&mdash;the most famous of whom was the celebrated
player, David Garrick. In 1737 he went up to London, and for the next
quarter of a century struggled for a living by the aid of his pen.
During the first ten years of his London life he wrote chiefly for the
‘Gentleman’s Magazine.’ In 1738 his <b>London</b>&mdash;a&nbsp;poem in
heroic metre&mdash;appeared. In 1747 he began his famous
<b>Dictionary</b>; it was completed in 1755; and the University of
Oxford conferred on him the honorary degree of M.A. In 1749 he wrote
another poem&mdash;also in heroic metre&mdash;the ‘Vanity of Human
Wishes.’ In 1750 he had begun the periodical that raised his fame to its
full height&mdash;a&nbsp;periodical to which he gave the name of <b>The
Rambler</b>. It appeared twice a-week; and Dr&nbsp;Johnson wrote every
article in it for two years. In 1759 he published the short novel called
<b>Rasselas</b>: it was written to defray the expenses of his mother’s
funeral; and he wrote it “in the evenings of a week.” The year 1762 saw
him with a pension from the Government of £300 a-year; and henceforth he
was free from heavy hack-work and literary drudgery, and could give
himself up to the largest enjoyment of that for which he cared
most&mdash;social conversation. He was the best talker of his time; and
he knew everybody worth knowing&mdash;Burke, Goldsmith, Gibbon, the
great painter Sir Joshua Reynolds, and many other able men. In 1764 he
founded the “Literary Club,” which still exists and meets in London.
Oddly enough, although a prolific writer, it is to another
person&mdash;to Mr&nbsp;James Boswell, who first met him in
1763&mdash;that he owes his greatest and most lasting fame. A&nbsp;much
larger number of persons read <b>Boswell’s Life of Johnson</b>&mdash;one
of the most entertaining books in all literature&mdash;than Johnson’s
own works. Between the years 1779 and 1781 appeared his last and ablest
work, <b>The Lives of the Poets</b>, which were written as prefaces to a
collective edition of the English Poets, published by several London
booksellers. He died in 1784.</p>

Johnson’s earlier style was full of Latin words; his later style is more
purely English than most of the journalistic writing of the present day.
His Rambler is full of “long-tailed words in <i>osity</i> and
<span class = "pagenum">325</span>
<!--png 143-->
<i>ation</i>;” but his ‘Lives of the Poets’ is written in manly,
vigorous, and idiomatic English. In verse, he occupies a place between
Pope and Goldsmith, and is one of the masters in the “didactic school”
of English poetry. His rhythm and periods are swelling and sonorous; and
here and there he equals Pope in the terseness and condensation of his
language. The following is a fair specimen:&mdash;</p>

county of Longford, Ireland, in the year 1728. His father was an Irish
clergyman, careless, good-hearted, and the original of the famous

Oliver was educated at Trinity College, Dublin; but he left it with no
fixed aim. He thought of law, and set off for London, but spent all his
money in Dublin. He thought of medicine, and resided two years in
Edinburgh. He started for Leyden, in Holland, to continue what he called
his medical studies; but he had a thirst to see the world&mdash;and so,
with a guinea in his pocket, one shirt, and a flute, he set out on his
travels through the continent of Europe. At length, on the 1st of
February 1756, he landed at Dover, after an absence of two years,
without a farthing in his pocket. London reached, he tried many ways of
making a living, as assistant to an apothecary, physician, reader for
the press, usher in a school, writer in journals. His first work was ‘An
Inquiry into the State of Polite Learning in Europe,’ in 1759; but it
appeared without his name. From that date he wrote books of all kinds,
poems, and plays. He died in his chambers in Brick Court, Temple,
London, in 1774.</p>

<b>She Stoops to Conquer</b>. His best prose work is <b>The Vicar of

histories of England, of Rome, of Animated Nature. All this was done as
professional, nay, almost as hack work; but

always in a very pleasant, lively, and readable style. Ease, grace,
charm, naturalness, pleasant rhythm, purity of diction&mdash;these were
the chief characteristics of his writings. “Almost to all things could
he turn his hand”&mdash;poem, essay, play, story, history, natural
science. Even when satirical, he was good-natured; and his
<b>Retaliation</b> is the friendliest and pleasantest of satires. In his
poetry, his words seem artless, but are indeed delicately chosen with
that consummate art which conceals and effaces itself: where he seems
most simple and easy, there he has taken most pains and given most
labour.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Edmund Burke</span> (<b>1730-1797</b>) was
born at Dublin in the year 1730. He was educated at Trinity College,
Dublin; and in 1747 was entered of the Middle Temple, with the purpose
of reading for the Bar. In 1766 he was so fortunate as to enter
Parliament as member for Wendover, in Buckinghamshire; and he sat in the
House of Commons for nearly thirty years. While in Parliament, he worked
hard to obtain justice for the colonists of North America, and to avert
the separation of them from the mother country; and also to secure good
government for India. At the close of his life, it was his intention to
take his seat in the House of Peers as Earl Beaconsfield&mdash;the title
afterwards assumed by Mr&nbsp;Disraeli; but the death of his son, and
only child&mdash;for whom the honour was really meant and
wished&mdash;quite broke his heart, and he never carried out his
purpose. He died at Beaconsfield in the year 1797. The lines of
Goldsmith on Burke, in his poem of “Retaliation,” are well
known:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“Here lies our good Edmund, whose genius was such</p>

Burke’s most famous writings are <b>Thoughts on the Cause of the present
Discontents</b>, published in 1773; <b>Reflections on the Trench
Revolution</b> (1790); and the <b>Letters on a Regicide Peace</b>
(1797). His “Thoughts” is perhaps the best of his works in point of
style; his “Reflections,” are full of passages of the highest and most
noble eloquence. Burke has been described by a great critic as “the
supreme writer of the century;” and Macaulay says, that “in richness of
imagination, he is superior to every orator ancient and modern.” In the
power of expressing thought in the strongest, fullest, and most vivid
manner, he must be classed with Shakespeare

and Bacon&mdash;and with these writers when at their best. He indulges
in repetitions; but the repetitions are never monotonous; they serve to
place the subject in every possible point of view, and to enable us to
see all sides of it. He possessed an enormous vocabulary, and had the
fullest power over it; “never was a man under whose hands language was
more plastic and ductile.” He is very fond of metaphor, and is described
by an able critic as “the greatest master of metaphor that the world has
ever seen.”</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Edward Gibbon</span> (<b>1737-1794</b>), the
second great prose-writer of the second half of the eighteenth century,
was born at Putney, London, in 1737. His father was a wealthy landowner.
Young Gibbon was a very sickly child&mdash;the only survivor of a
delicate family of seven; he was left to pass his time as he pleased,
and for the most part to educate himself. But he had the run of several
good libraries; and he was an eager and never satiated reader. He was
sent to Oxford at the early age of fifteen; and so full was his
knowledge in some directions, and so defective in others, that he went
there, he tells us himself, “with a stock of knowledge that might have
puzzled a doctor, and a degree of ignorance of which a schoolboy would
have been ashamed.” He was very fond of disputation while at Oxford; and
the Dons of the University were astonished to see the pathetic “thin
little figure, with a large head, disputing and arguing with the
greatest ability.” In the course of his reading, he lighted on some
French and English books that convinced him for the time of the truth of
the Roman Catholic faith; he openly professed his change of belief; and
this obliged him to leave the University. His father sent him to
Lausanne, and placed him under the care of a Swiss clergyman there,
whose arguments were at length successful in bringing him back to a
belief in Protestantism. On his return to England in 1758, he lived in
his father’s house in Hampshire; read largely, as usual; but also joined
the Hampshire militia as captain of a company, and the exercises and
manœuvres of his regiment gave him an insight into military matters
which was afterwards useful to him when he came to write history. He
published his first work in 1761. It was an essay on the study of
literature, and was written in French. In 1770 his father died; he came
into a fortune, entered Parliament, where he sat for eight years, but
never spoke; and, in 1776, he began his history of the <b>Decline and
Fall of the Roman Empire</b>. This, by far the greatest of his works,
was not completed till 1787, and was published in 1788, on his
fifty-first birthday. His
<span class = "pagenum">328</span>
<!--png 146-->
account of the completion of the work&mdash;it was finished at Lausanne,
where he had lived for six years&mdash;is full of beauty: “It was on the
day, or rather night, of June 27, 1787, between the hours of eleven and
twelve, that I wrote the last lines of the last page in a summer-house
in my garden. After laying down my pen, I&nbsp;took several turns in a
covered walk of acacias, which commands a prospect of the country, the
lake, and the mountains. The air was temperate, the sky was serene. The
silver orb of the moon was reflected from the waters, and all nature was
silent. I&nbsp;will not describe the first emotion of joy on the
recovery of my freedom, and perhaps the establishment of my fame. But my
pride was soon humbled, and a sober melancholy was spread over my mind
by the idea that I had taken an everlasting leave of an old and
agreeable companion, and that, whatever might be the future fate of my
history, the life of the historian must be short and precarious.” Gibbon
died in 1794, about one year before the birth of another great
historian, Grote, the author of the ‘History of Greece.’</p>

Gibbon’s book is one of the great historical works of the world. It
covers a space of about thirteen centuries, from the reign of Trajan
(98), to the fall of the Eastern Empire in 1453; and the amount of
reading and study required to write it, must have been almost beyond the
power of our conceiving. The skill in arranging and disposing the
enormous mass of matter in his history is also unparalleled. His style
is said by a critic to be “copious, splendid, elegantly rounded,
distinguished by supreme artificial skill.” It is remarkable for the
proportion of Latin words employed. While some parts of our translation
of the Bible contain as much as 96 per cent of pure English words,
Gibbon has only 58 per cent: the rest, or 42 per cent, are words of
Latin origin. In fact, of all our great English writers, Gibbon stands
lowest in his use of pure English words; and the two writers who come
nearest him in this respect are Johnson and Swift. The great Greek
scholar, Professor Porson, said of Gibbon’s style, that “there could not
be a better exercise for a schoolboy than to turn a page of it into
English.”</p>

<b>Poets.</b>&mdash;The chief poets of the latter half of the eighteenth
century belong to a new world, and show very little trace in their
writings of eighteenth-century culture, ideas, or prejudices. Most of
the best poets who were born in this half of the eighteenth century and
began to write in it&mdash;such as Crabbe and Wordsworth&mdash;are true
denizens, in the character of their minds and feelings, of the
nineteenth. The greatest poets of the
<span class = "pagenum">329</span>
<!--png 147-->
period are <b>Cowper</b>, <b>Crabbe</b>, and <b>Burns</b>; and along
with these may be mentioned as little inferior, <b>Chatterton</b> and
<b>Blake</b>, two of the most original poets that have appeared in any
literature.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">William Cowper</span> (<b>1731-1800</b>), one
of the truest, purest, and sweetest of English poets, was born at Great
Berkhampstead, in Hertfordshire, in 1731. His father, Dr&nbsp;Cowper,
who was a nephew of Lord Chancellor Cowper, was rector of the parish,
and chaplain to George II. Young Cowper was educated at Westminster
School; and “the great proconsul of India,” Warren Hastings, was one of
his schoolfellows. After leaving Westminster, he was entered of the
Middle Temple, and was also articled to a solicitor. At the age of
thirty-one he was appointed one of the Clerks to the House of Lords; but
he was so terribly nervous and timid, that he threw up the appointment.
He was next appointed Clerk of the Journals&mdash;a&nbsp;post which even
the shyest man might hold; but, when he found that he would have to
appear at the bar of the House of Lords, he went home and attempted to
commit suicide. When at school, he had been terribly and persistently
bullied; and, about this time, his mind had been somewhat affected by a
disappointment in love. The form of his insanity was melancholia; and he
had several long and severe attacks of the same disease in the
after-course of his life. He had to be placed in the keeping of a
physician; and it was only after fifteen months’ seclusion that he was
able to face the world. Giving up all idea of professional or of public
life, he went to live at Huntingdon with the Unwins; and, after the
death of Mr&nbsp;Unwin, he removed with Mrs&nbsp;Unwin to Olney, in
Buckinghamshire. Here, in 1773, another attack of melancholia came upon
him. In 1779, Cowper joined with Mr&nbsp;Newton, the curate of the
parish, in publishing the <b>Olney Hymns</b>, of which he wrote
sixty-eight. But it was not till he was past fifty years of age that he
betook himself seriously to the writing of poetry. His first volume,
which contained <b>Table-Talk</b>, <b>Conversation</b>,
<b>Retirement</b>, and other poems in heroic metre, appeared in 1782.
His second volume, which included <b>The Task</b> and <b>John
Gilpin</b>, was published in 1785. His translation of the <b>Iliad</b>
and <b>Odyssey</b> of Homer&mdash;a&nbsp;translation into blank verse,
which he wrote at the regular rate of forty lines a-day&mdash;was
published in 1791. Mrs&nbsp;Unwin now had a shock of paralysis; Cowper
himself was again seized with mental illness; and from 1791 till his
death in 1800, his condition was one of extreme misery, depression, and
despair. He thought himself an outcast from the mercy of God.
“I&nbsp;seem to
<span class = "pagenum">330</span>
<!--png 148-->
myself,” he wrote to a friend, “to be scrambling always in the dark,
among rocks and precipices, without a guide, but with an enemy ever at
my heels, prepared to push me headlong.” The cloud never lifted; gloom
and dejection enshrouded all his later years; a&nbsp;pension of £300
a-year from George III. brought him no pleasure; and he died insane, at
East Dereham, in Norfolk, in the year 1800. In the poem of <b>The
Castaway</b> he compares himself to a drowning sailor:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“No voice divine the storm allayed,</p>

His greatest work is <b>The Task</b>; and the best poem in it is
probably “The Winter Evening.” His best-known poem is <b>John
Gilpin</b>, which, like “The Task,” he wrote at the request of his
friend, Lady Austen. His most powerful poem is <b>The Castaway</b>. He
always writes in clear, crisp, pleasant, and manly English. He himself
says, in a letter to a friend: “Perspicuity is always more than half the
battle... A&nbsp;meaning that does not stare you in the face is as bad
as no meaning;” and this direction he himself always carried out.
Cowper’s poems mark a new era in poetry; his style is new, and his ideas
are new. He is no follower of Pope; Southey compared Pope and Cowper as
“formal gardens in comparison with woodland scenery.” He is always
original, always true&mdash;true to his own feeling, and true to the
object he is describing. “My descriptions,” he writes of “The Task,”
“are all from nature; not one of them second-handed. My delineations of
the heart are from my own experience.” Everywhere in his poems we find a
genuine love of nature; humour and pathos in his description of persons;
and a purity and honesty of style that have never been surpassed. Many
of his well-put lines have passed into our common stock of everyday
quotations. Such are&mdash;</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">George Crabbe</span> (<b>1754-1832</b>), the
poet of the poor, was born at Aldborough, in Suffolk, on Christmas Eve
of the year 1754. He stands thus midway between Goldsmith and
Wordsworth&mdash;midway between the old and the new school of poetry.
His father was salt-master&mdash;or collector of salt duties&mdash;at
the little seaport. After being taught a little at several schools, it
was agreed that George should be made a surgeon. He was accordingly
apprenticed; but he was fonder of writing verses than of attending
cases. His memory for poetry was astonishing; he had begun to write
verses at the age of fourteen; and he filled the drawers of the surgery
with his poetical attempts. After a time he set up for himself in
practice at Aldborough; but most of his patients were poor people and
poor relations, who paid him neither for his physic nor his advice. In
1779 he resolved “to go to London and venture all.” Accordingly, he took
a berth on board of a sailing-packet, carrying with him a little money
and a number of manuscript poems. But nothing succeeded with him; he was
reduced to his last eightpence. In this strait, he wrote to the great
statesman, Edmund Burke; and, while the answer was coming, he walked all
night up and down Westminster Bridge. Burke took him in to his own house
and found a publisher for his poems.</p>

In 1781 <b>The Library</b> appeared; and in the same year Crabbe entered
the Church. In 1783 he published <b>The Village</b>&mdash;a&nbsp;poem
which Dr&nbsp;Johnson revised for him. This work won for him an
established reputation; but, for twenty-four years after, Crabbe gave
himself up entirely to the care of his parish, and published only one
poem&mdash;<b>The Newspaper</b>. In 1807 appeared <b>The Parish
Register</b>; in 1810, <b>The Borough</b>; in 1812, <b>Tales in
Verse</b>; and, in 1819, his last poetical work, <b>Tales of the
Hall</b>. From this time, till his death in 1832&mdash;thirteen years
after&mdash;he produced no other poem. Personally, he was one of the
noblest and kindest of men; he was known as “the gentleman with the sour
name and the sweet countenance;” and he spent most of his income on the
wants of others.</p>

Crabbe’s poetical work forms a prominent landmark in English literature.
His style is the style of the eighteenth century&mdash;with a strong
admixture of his own; his way of thinking, and the objects he selects
for description, belong to the nineteenth. While Pope depicted “the
town,” politics, and abstract moralities, Crabbe describes the country
and the country poor, social matters, real life&mdash;the lowest and
poorest life, and more especially, the intense misery of the village
population of his time in the eastern counties&mdash;</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Robert Burns</span> (<b>1759-1796</b>), the
greatest poet of Scotland, was born in Ayrshire, two miles from the town
of Ayr, in 1759. The only education he received from his father was the
schooling of a few months; but the family were fond of reading, and
Robert was the most enthusiastic reader of them all. Every spare moment
he could find&mdash;and they were not many&mdash;he gave to reading; he
sat at meals “with a book in one hand and a spoon in the other;” and in
this way he read most of the great English poets and prose-writers. This
was an excellent education&mdash;one a great deal better than most
people receive; and some of our greatest men have had no better. But, up
to the age of sixteen, he had to toil on his father’s farm from early
morning till late at night. In the intervals of his work he contrived,
by dint of thrift and industry, to learn French, mathematics, and a
little Latin. On the death of his father, he took a small farm, but did
not succeed. He was on the point of embarking for Jamaica, where a post
had been found for him, when the news of the successful sale of a small
volume of his poems reached him; and he at once changed his mind, and
gave up all idea of emigrating. His friends obtained for him a post as
exciseman, in which his duty was to gauge the quantity and quality of
ardent spirits&mdash;a&nbsp;post full of dangers to a man of his
excitable and emotional temperament. He went a great deal into what was
called society, formed the acquaintance of many boon companions,
acquired habits of intemperance that he could not shake off, and died at
Dumfries in 1796, in his thirty-seventh year.</p>

His best poems are lyrical, and he is himself one of the foremost
<span class = "pagenum">333</span>
<!--png 151-->
lyrical poets in the world. His songs have probably been more sung, and
in more parts of the globe, than the songs of any other writer that ever
lived. They are of every kind&mdash;songs of love, war, mirth, sorrow,
labour, and social gatherings. Professor Craik says: “One characteristic
that belongs to whatever Burns has written is that, of its kind and in
its own way, it is a perfect production. His poetry is, throughout, real
emotion melodiously uttered, instinct with passion, but not less so with
power of thought,&mdash;full of light as well as of fire.” Most of his
poems are written in the North-English, or Lowland-Scottish, dialect.
The most elevated of his poems is <b>The Vision</b>, in which he relates
how the Scottish Muse found him at the plough, and crowned him with a
wreath of holly. One of his longest, as well as finest poems, is <b>The
Cottar’s Saturday Night</b>, which is written in the Spenserian stanza.
Perhaps his most pathetic poem is that entitled <b>To Mary in
Heaven</b>. It is of a singular eloquence, elevation, and sweetness. The
first verse runs thus&mdash;</p>

kind.&mdash;Chatterton was born at Bristol in the year 1752. He was the
son of a schoolmaster, who died before he was born. He was educated at
Colston’s Blue-Coat School in Bristol; and, while at school, read his
way steadily through every book in three circulating libraries. He began
to write verses at the age of fifteen, and in two years had produced a
large number of poems&mdash;some of them of the highest value. In 1770,
he came up to London, with something under five pounds in his pocket,
and his mind made up to try his fortune as a literary man, resolved,
though he was only a boy of seventeen, to live by literature or to die.
Accordingly, he set to work and wrote every kind of
productions&mdash;poems,
<span class = "pagenum">334</span>
<!--png 152-->
essays, stories, political articles, songs for public singers; and all
the time he was half starving. A&nbsp;loaf of bread lasted him a week;
and it was “bought stale to make it last longer.” He had made a friend
of the Lord Mayor, Beckford; but before he had time to hold out a hand
to the struggling boy, Beckford died. The struggle became harder and
harder&mdash;more and more hopeless; his neighbours offered a little
help&mdash;a&nbsp;small coin or a meal&mdash;he rejected all; and at
length, on the evening of the 24th August 1770, he went up to his
garret, locked himself in, tore up all his manuscripts, took poison, and
died. He was only seventeen.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">William Blake</span> (<b>1757-1827</b>), one
of the most original poets that ever lived, was born in London in the
year 1757. He was brought up as an engraver; worked steadily at his
business, and did a great deal of beautiful work in that capacity. He in
fact illustrated his own poems&mdash;each page being set in a fantastic
design of his own invention, which he himself engraved. He was also his
own printer and publisher. The first volume of his poems was published
in 1783; the <b>Songs of Innocence</b>, probably his best, appeared in
1787. He died in Fountain Court, Strand, London, in the year 1827.</p>

His latest critic says of Blake: “His detachment from the ordinary
currents of practical thought left to his mind an unspoiled and
delightful simplicity which has perhaps never been matched in English
poetry.” Simplicity&mdash;the perfect simplicity of a child&mdash;
<span class = "pagenum">335</span>
<!--png 153-->
beautiful simplicity&mdash;simple and childlike beauty,&mdash;such is
the chief note of the poetry of Blake. “Where he is successful, his work
has the fresh perfume and perfect grace of a flower.” The most
remarkable point about Blake is that, while living in an age when the
poetry of Pope&mdash;and that alone&mdash;was everywhere paramount, his
poems show not the smallest trace of Pope’s influence, but are
absolutely original. His work, in fact, seems to be the first bright
streak of the golden dawn that heralded the approach of the full and
splendid daylight of the poetry of Wordsworth and Coleridge, of Shelley
and Byron. His best-known poems are those from the ‘Songs of
Innocence’&mdash;such as <b>Piping down the valleys wild</b>; <b>The
Lamb</b>; <b>The Tiger</b>, and others. Perhaps the most remarkable
element in Blake’s poetry is the sweetness and naturalness of the
rhythm. It seems careless, but it is always beautiful; it grows, it is
not made; it is like a wild field-flower thrown up by Nature in a
pleasant green field. Such are the rhythms in the poem entitled
<b>Night</b>:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“The sun descending in the west,</p>
<p>The evening star does shine;</p>
<p>The birds are silent in their nest,</p>
<p>And I must seek for mine.</p>
<p>The moon, like a flower</p>
<p>In heaven’s high bower,</p>
<p>With silent delight</p>
<p>Sits and smiles on the night.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
“Farewell, green fields and happy grove,</p>
<p>Where flocks have ta’en delight;</p>
<p>Where lambs have nibbled, silent move</p>
<p>The feet of angels bright:</p>

<p>And joy without ceasing,</p>

CHAPTER VIII.</a></h4>

<h6>THE FIRST HALF OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.</h6>


<p><a name = "partIV_chapVIII_sec1" id = "partIV_chapVIII_sec1">1.</a>
<b>New Ideas.</b>&mdash;The end of the eighteenth and the beginning of
the nineteenth century are alike remarkable for the new powers, new
ideas, and new life thrown into society. The coming up of a high
flood-tide of new forces seems to coincide with the beginning of the
French Revolution in 1789, when the overthrow of the Bastille marked the
downfall of the old ways of thinking and acting, and announced to the
world of Europe and America that the old <i>régime</i>&mdash;the ancient
mode of governing&mdash;was over. Wordsworth, then a lad of nineteen,
was excited by the event almost beyond the bounds of self-control. He
says in his “Excursion”&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,</p>
<p>But to be young was very Heaven!”</p>
</div>

<p>It was, indeed, the dawn of a new day for the peoples of Europe. The
ideas of freedom and equality&mdash;of respect for man as man&mdash;were
thrown into popular form by France; they became living powers in Europe;
and in England they animated and inspired the best minds of the
time&mdash;Burns, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Shelley, and Byron. Along with
this high tide of hope and emotion, there was such an outburst of talent
and genius in every kind of human endeavour in England, as was never
seen before except in the Elizabethan period. Great events produced
great powers; and great powers in their turn
<span class = "pagenum">337</span>
<!--png 155-->
brought about great events. The war with America, the long struggle with
Napoleon, the new political ideas, great victories by sea and
land,&mdash;all these were to be found in the beginning of the
nineteenth century. The English race produced great men in
numbers&mdash;almost, it might be said, in groups. We had great leaders,
like Nelson and Wellington; brilliant generals, like Sir Charles Napier
and Sir John Moore; great statesmen, like Fox and Pitt, like Washington
and Franklin; great engineers, like Stephenson and Brunel; and great
poets, like Wordsworth and Byron. And as regards literature, an able
critic remarks: “We have recovered in this century the Elizabethan magic
and passion, a&nbsp;more than Elizabethan sense of the beauty and
complexity of nature, the Elizabethan music of language.”</p>

<p><a name = "partIV_chapVIII_sec2" id = "partIV_chapVIII_sec2">2.</a>
<b>Great Poets.</b>&mdash;The greatest poets of the first half of the
nineteenth century may be best arranged in groups. There were
<b>Wordsworth</b>, <b>Coleridge</b>, and <b>Southey</b>&mdash;commonly,
but unnecessarily, described as the Lake Poets. In their poetic thought
and expression they had little in common; and the fact that two of them
lived most of their lives in the Lake country, is not a sufficient
justification for the use of the term. There were <b>Scott</b> and
<b>Campbell</b>&mdash;both of them Scotchmen. There were <b>Byron</b>
and <b>Shelley</b>&mdash;both Englishmen, both brought up at the great
public schools and the universities, but both carried away by the
influence of the new revolutionary ideas. Lastly, there were
<b>Moore</b>, an Irishman, and young <b>Keats</b>, the splendid promise
of whose youth went out in an early death. Let us learn a little more
about each, and in the order of the dates of their birth.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">William Wordsworth</span> (<b>1770-1850</b>)
was born at Cockermouth, a&nbsp;town in Cumberland, which stands at the
confluence of the Cocker and the Derwent. His father, John Wordsworth,
was law agent to Sir James Lowther, who afterwards became Earl of
Lonsdale. William was a boy of a stiff, moody, and violent temper; and
as his mother died when he was a very little boy, and his father when he
was fourteen, he grew up with very little care from his
<span class = "pagenum">338</span>
<!--png 156-->
parents and guardians. He was sent to school at Hawkshead, in the Vale
of Esthwaite, in Lancashire; and, at the age of seventeen, proceeded to
St&nbsp;John’s College, Cambridge. After taking his degree of B.A. in
1791, he resided for a year in France. He took sides with one of the
parties in the Reign of Terror, and left the country only in time to
save his head. He was designed by his uncles for the Church; but a
friend, Raisley Calvert, dying, left him £900; and he now resolved to
live a plain and frugal life, to join no profession, but to give himself
wholly up to the writing of poetry. In 1798, he published, along with
his friend, S.&nbsp;T. Coleridge, the <b>Lyrical Ballads</b>. The only
work of Coleridge’s in this volume was the “Ancient Mariner.” In 1802 he
married Mary Hutchinson, of whom he speaks in the well-known
lines&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“Her eyes as stars of Twilight fair,</p>
<p>Like Twilight’s, too, her dusky hair;</p>
<p>But all things else about her drawn</p>

</div>

<p class = "author">
He obtained the post of Distributor of Stamps for the county of
Westmoreland; and, after the death of Southey, he was created
<b>Poet-Laureate</b> by the Queen.&mdash;He settled with his wife in the
Lake country; and, in 1813, took up his abode at Rydal Mount, where he
lived till his death in 1850. He died on the 23d of April&mdash;the
death-day of Shakespeare.</p>

<p class = "author">
<a name = "partIV_chapVIII_sec4" id = "partIV_chapVIII_sec4">4.</a>
His longest works are the <b>Excursion</b> and the
<b>Prelude</b>&mdash;both being parts of a longer and greater work which
he intended to write on the growth of his own mind. His best poems are
his shorter pieces, such as the poems on <b>Lucy</b>, <b>The Cuckoo</b>,
the <b>Ode to Duty</b>, the <b>Intimations of Immortality</b>, and
several of his <b>Sonnets</b>. He says of his own poetry that his
purpose in writing it was “to console the afflicted; to add sunshine to
daylight by making the happy happier; to teach the young and the
gracious of every age to see, to think, and feel, and therefore to
become more actively and securely virtuous.” His poetical work is the
noble landmark of a great transition&mdash;both in thought and in style.
He drew aside poetry from questions and interests of mere society and
the town to the scenes of Nature and the deepest feelings of man as man.
In style, he refused to employ the old artificial vocabulary which Pope
and his followers revelled in; he used the simplest words he could find;
and, when he hits the mark in his simplest form of expression, his style
is as forcible as it is true. He says of his own verse&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class = "author">
If one were asked what four lines of his poetry best convey the feeling
of the whole, the reply must be that these are to be found in his “Song
at the Feast of Brougham Castle,”&mdash;lines written about “the good
Lord Clifford.”</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Walter Scott</span> (<b>1771-1832</b>), poet
and novelist, the son of a Scotch attorney (called in Edinburgh a W.S.
or Writer to H.M.’s Signet), was born there in the year 1771. He was
educated at the High School, and then at the College&mdash;now called
the University&mdash;of Edinburgh. In 1792 he was called to the Scottish
Bar, or became an “advocate.” During his boyhood, he had had several
illnesses, one of which left him lame for life. Through those long
periods of sickness and of convalescence, he read Percy’s ‘Reliques of
Ancient Poetry,’ and almost all the romances, old plays, and epic poems
that have been published in the English language. This gave his mind and
imagination a set which they never lost all through life.</p>

<p class = "author">
<a name = "partIV_chapVIII_sec6" id = "partIV_chapVIII_sec6">6.</a>
His first publications were translations of German poems. In the year
1805, however, an original poem, the <b>Lay of the Last Minstrel</b>,
appeared; and Scott became at one bound the foremost poet of the day.
<b>Marmion</b>, the <b>Lady of the Lake</b>, and other poems, followed
with great rapidity. But, in 1814, Scott took it into his head that his
poetical vein was worked out; the star of Byron was rising upon the
literary horizon; and he now gave himself up to novel-writing. His first
novel, <b>Waverley</b>, appeared anonymously in 1814. <b>Guy
Mannering</b>, <b>Old Mortality</b>, <b>Rob Roy</b>, and others, quickly
followed; and, though the secret of the authorship was well kept both by
printer and publisher, Walter Scott was generally believed to be the
writer of these works, and he was frequently spoken of as “the Great
Unknown.” He was made a baronet by George IV. in 1820.</p>

year of 1826; and Scott found himself unexpectedly liable for the large
sum of £147,000. Such a load of debt would have utterly crushed most
men; but Scott stood clear and undaunted in front of it. “Gentlemen,” he
said to his creditors, “time and I against any two. Let me take this
good ally into my company, and I believe I shall be able to pay you
every farthing.” He left his beautiful country house at Abbotsford; he
gave up all his country pleasures; he surrendered all his property to
his creditors; he took a small house in Edinburgh; and, in the short
space of five years, he had paid off £130,000. But the task was too
terrible; the pace had been too hard; and he was struck down by
paralysis. But even this disaster did not daunt him. Again he went to
work, and again he had a paralytic stroke. At last, however, he was
obliged to give up; the Government of the day placed a royal frigate at
his disposal; he went to Italy; but his health had utterly broken down,
he felt he could get no good from the air of the south, and he turned
his face towards home to die. He breathed his last breath at Abbotsford,
in sight of his beloved Tweed, with his family around him, on the 21st
of September 1832.</p>

His poetry is the poetry of action. In imaginative power he ranks below
no other poet, except Homer and Shakespeare. He delighted in war, in its
movement, its pageantry, and its events; and, though lame, he was
quartermaster of a volunteer corps of cavalry. On one occasion he rode
to muster one hundred miles in twenty-four hours, composing verses by
the way. Much of “<b>Marmion</b>” was composed on horseback. “I&nbsp;had
many a grand gallop,” he says, “when I was thinking of
‘<b>Marmion</b>.’” His two chief powers in verse are his narrative and
his pictorial power. His boyhood was passed in the Borderland of
Scotland&mdash;“a&nbsp;district in which every field has its battle and
every rivulet its song;” and he was at home in every part of the
Highlands and the Lowlands, the Islands and the Borders, of his native
country. But, both in his novels and his poems, he was a painter of
action rather than of character.</p>

His prose works are now much more read than his poems; but both are full
of life, power, literary skill, knowledge of men and women, and strong
sympathy with all past ages. He wrote so fast that his sentences are
often loose and ungrammatical; but they are never unidiomatic or stiff.
The rush of a strong and large life goes through them, and carries the
reader along, forgetful of all minor blemishes. His best novels are
<b>Old Mortality</b> and <b>Kenilworth</b>; his greatest romance is
<b>Ivanhoe</b>.</p>

a writer of noble prose, was born at Ottery St&nbsp;Mary, in Devonshire,
in 1772. His father, who was vicar of the parish, and master of the
grammar-school, died when the boy was only nine years of age. He was
educated at Christ’s Hospital, in London, where his most famous
schoolfellow was Charles Lamb; and from there he went to Jesus College,
Cambridge. In 1793 he had fallen into debt at College; and, in despair,
left Cambridge, and enlisted in the 15th Light Dragoons, under the name
of Silas Tomkins Comberbatch. He was quickly discovered, and his
discharge soon obtained. While on a visit to his friend Robert Southey,
at Bristol, the plan of emigrating to the banks of the Susquehanna, in
Pennsylvania, was entered on; but, when all the friends and
fellow-emigrants were ready to start, it was discovered that no one of
them had any money.&mdash;Coleridge finally became a literary man and
journalist. His real power, however, lay in poetry; but by poetry he
could not make a living. His first volume of poems was published at
Bristol, in the year 1796; but it was not till 1798 that the <b>Rime of
the Ancient Mariner</b> appeared in the ‘Lyrical Ballads.’ His next
greatest poem, <b>Christabel</b>, though written in 1797, was not
published till the year 1816. His other best poems are <b>Love</b>;
<b>Dejection&mdash;an Ode</b>; and some of his shorter pieces. His best
poetry was written about the close of the century: “Coleridge,” said
Wordsworth, “was in blossom from 1796 to 1800.”&mdash;As a critic and
prose-writer, he is one of the greatest men of his time. His best works
in prose are <b>The Friend</b> and the <b>Aids to Reflection</b>. He
died at Highgate, near London, in the year 1834.</p>

His style, both in prose and in verse, marks the beginning of the modern
era. His prose style is noble, elaborate, eloquent, and full of subtle
and involved thought; his style in verse is always musical, and abounds
in rhythms of the most startling and novel&mdash;yet always
genuine&mdash;kind. <b>Christabel</b> is the poem that is most full of
these fine musical rhythms.</p>

Southey wrote a great deal of verse, but much more prose. His prose
works amount to more than one hundred volumes; but his poetry, such as
it is, will probably live longer than his prose. His best-known poems
are <b>Joan of Arc</b>, written when he was nineteen; <b>Thalaba the

<span class = "smallcaps">George Gordon, Lord Byron</span>
(<b>1788-1824</b>), a&nbsp;great English poet, was born in London in the
year 1788. He was the only child of a reckless and unprincipled father
and a passionate mother. He was educated at Harrow School, and
afterwards at Trinity College, Cambridge. His first
volume&mdash;<b>Hours of Idleness</b>&mdash;was published in 1807,
before he was nineteen. A&nbsp;critique of this juvenile work which
appeared in the ‘Edinburgh Review’ stung him to passion; and he produced
a very vigorous poetical reply in <b>English Bards and Scotch
Reviewers</b>. After the publication of this book, Byron travelled in
Germany, Spain, Greece, and Turkey for two years; and the first two
cantos of the poem entitled <b>Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</b> were the
outcome of these travels. This poem at once placed him at the head of
English poets; “he woke one morning,” he said, “and found himself
famous.” He was married in the year 1815, but left his wife in the
following year; left his native country also, never to return. First of
all he settled at Geneva, where he made the acquaintance of the poet
Shelley, and where he wrote, among other poems, the third canto of
<b>Childe Harold</b> and the <b>Prisoner of Chillon</b>. In 1817 he
removed to Venice, where he
<span class = "pagenum">344</span>
<!--png 162-->
composed the fourth canto of <b>Childe Harold</b> and the <b>Lament of
Tasso</b>; his next resting-place was Ravenna, where he wrote several
plays. Pisa saw him next; and at this place he spent a great deal of his
time in close intimacy with Shelley. In 1821 the Greek nation rose in
revolt against the cruelties and oppression of the Turkish rule; and
Byron’s sympathies were strongly enlisted on the side of the Greeks. He
helped the struggling little country with contributions of money; and,
in 1823, sailed from Geneva to take a personal share in the war of
liberation. He died, however, of fever, at Missolonghi, on the 19th of
April 1824, at the age of thirty-six.</p>

His best-known work is <b>Childe Harold</b>, which is written in the
Spenserian stanza. His plays, the best of which are <b>Manfred</b> and
<b>Sardanapālus</b>, are written in blank verse.&mdash;His style is
remarkable for its strength and elasticity, for its immensely powerful
sweep, tireless energy, and brilliant illustrations.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>
(<b>1792-1822</b>),&mdash;who has, like Spenser, been called “the poet’s
poet,”&mdash;was born at Field Place, near Horsham, in Sussex, in the
year 1792. He was educated at Eton, and then at University College,
Oxford. A&nbsp;shy, diffident, retiring boy, with sweet, gentle looks
and manners&mdash;like those of a girl&mdash;but with a spirit of the
greatest fearlessness and the noblest independence, he took little share
in the sports and pursuits of his schoolfellows. Obliged to leave
Oxford, in consequence of having written a tract of which the
authorities did not approve, he married at the very early age of
nineteen. The young lady whom he married died in 1816; and he soon after
married Mary, daughter of William Godwin, the eminent author of
‘Political Justice.’ In 1818 he left England for Italy,&mdash;like his
friend, Lord Byron, for ever. It was at Naples, Leghorn, and Pisa that
he chiefly resided. In 1822 he bought a little
boat&mdash;“a&nbsp;perfect plaything for the summer,” he calls it; and
he used often to make short voyages in it, and wrote many of his poems
on these occasions. When Leigh Hunt was lying ill at Leghorn, Shelley
and his friend Williams resolved on a coasting trip to that city. They
reached Leghorn in safety; but, on the return journey, the boat sank in
a sudden squall. Captain Roberts was watching the vessel with his glass
from the top of the Leghorn lighthouse, as it crossed the Bay of
Spezzia: a&nbsp;black cloud arose; a&nbsp;storm came down; the vessels
sailing with Shelley’s boat were wrapped in darkness; the cloud passed;
the sun shone out, and all was clear again; the larger vessels rode on;
but Shelley’s boat had disappeared. The poet’s body was cast on
<span class = "pagenum">345</span>
<!--png 163-->
shore, but the quarantine laws of Italy required that everything thrown
up on the coast should be burned: no representations could alter the
law; and Shelley’s ashes were placed in a box and buried in the
Protestant cemetery at Rome.</p>

Shelley’s best long poem is the <b>Adonaïs</b>, an elegy on the death of
John Keats. It is written in the Spenserian stanza. But this true poet
will be best remembered by his short lyrical poems, such as <b>The
Cloud</b>, <b>Ode to a Skylark</b>, <b>Ode to the West Wind</b>,
<b>Stanzas written in Dejection</b>, and others.&mdash;Shelley has been
called “the poet’s poet,” because his style is so thoroughly transfused
by pure imagination. He has also been called “the master-singer of our
modern race and age; for his thoughts, his words, and his deeds all sang
together.” He is probably the greatest lyric poet of this century.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">John Keats</span> (<b>1795-1821</b>), one of
our truest poets, was born in Moorfields, London, in the year 1795. He
was educated at a private school at Enfield. His desire for the
pleasures of the intellect and the imagination showed itself very early
at school; and he spent many a half-holiday in writing translations from
the Roman and the French poets. On leaving school, he was apprenticed to
a surgeon at Edmonton&mdash;the scene of one of John Gilpin’s
adventures; but, in 1817, he gave up the practice of surgery, devoted
himself entirely to poetry, and brought out his first volume. In 1818
appeared his <b>Endymion</b>. The ‘Quarterly Review’ handled it without
mercy. Keats’s health gave way; the seeds of consumption were in his
frame; and he was ordered to Italy in 1820, as the last chance of saving
his life. But it was too late. The air of Italy could not restore him.
He settled at Rome with his friend Severn; but, in spite of all the
care, thought, devotion, and watching of his friend, he died in 1821, at
the age of twenty-five. He was buried in the Protestant cemetery at
Rome; and the inscription on his tomb, composed by himself, is, “<i>Here
lies one whose name was writ in water</i>.”</p>

best remembered by his marvellous odes, such as the <b>Ode to a

<b>Prose-Writers.</b>&mdash;We have now to consider the greatest
prose-writers of the first half of the nineteenth century. First comes
<b>Walter Scott</b>, one of the greatest novelists that ever lived, and
who won the name of “The Wizard of the North” from the marvellous power
he possessed of enchaining the attention and fascinating the minds of
his readers. Two other great writers of prose were <b>Charles Lamb</b>
and <b>Walter Savage Landor</b>, each in styles essentially different.
<b>Jane Austen</b>, a&nbsp;young English lady, has become a classic in
prose, because her work is true and perfect within its own sphere. <b>De
Quincey</b> is perhaps the writer of the most ornate and elaborate
English prose of this period. <b>Thomas Carlyle</b>, a&nbsp;great
Scotsman, with a style of overwhelming power, but of occasional
grotesqueness, like a great prophet and teacher of the nation, compelled
statesmen and philanthropists to think, while he also gained for himself
a high place in the rank of historians. <b>Macaulay</b>, also of
Scottish descent, was one of the greatest essayists and ablest writers
on history that Great Britain has produced. A&nbsp;short survey of each
of these great men may be useful. Scott has been already
treated&nbsp;of.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Charles Lamb</span> (<b>1775-1834</b>), a
perfect English essayist, was born in the Inner Temple, in London, in
the year 1775. His father was clerk to a barrister of that Inn of Court.
Charles was educated at Christ’s Hospital, where his most famous
schoolfellow was S.&nbsp;T. Coleridge. Brought up in the very heart of
London, he had always a strong feeling for the greatness of the
metropolis of the world. “I&nbsp;often shed tears,” he said, “in the
motley Strand, for fulness of joy at so much life.” He was, indeed,
a&nbsp;thorough Cockney and lover of London, as were also Chaucer,
<span class = "pagenum">347</span>
<!--png 165-->
Spenser, Milton, and Lamb’s friend Leigh Hunt. Entering the India House
as a clerk in the year 1792, he remained there thirty-three years; and
it was one of his odd sayings that, if any one wanted to see his
“works,” he would find them on the shelves of the India House.&mdash;He
is greatest as a writer of prose; and his prose is, in its way,
unequalled for sweetness, grace, humour, and quaint terms, among the
writings of this century. His best prose work is the <b>Essays of
Elia</b>, which show on every page the most whimsical and humorous
subtleties, a&nbsp;quick play of intellect, and a deep sympathy with the
sorrows and the joys of men. Very little verse came from his pen.
“Charles Lamb’s nosegay of verse,” says Professor Dowden, “may be held
by the small hand of a maiden, and there is not in it one flaunting
flower.” Perhaps the best of his poems are the short pieces entitled
<b>Hester</b> and <b>The Old Familiar Faces</b>.&mdash;He retired from
the India House, on a pension, in 1825, and died at Edmonton, near
London, in 1834. His character was as sweet and refined as his style;
Wordsworth spoke of him as “Lamb the frolic and the gentle;” and these
and other fine qualities endeared him to a large circle of friends.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Walter Savage Landor</span>
(<b>1775-1864</b>), the greatest prose-writer in his own style of the
nineteenth century, was born at Ipsley Court, in Warwickshire, on the
30th of January 1775&mdash;the anniversary of the execution of
Charles&nbsp;I. He was educated at Rugby School and at Oxford; but his
fierce and insubordinate temper&mdash;which remained with him, and
injured him all his life&mdash;procured his expulsion from both of these
places. As heir to a large estate, he resolved to give himself up
entirely to literature; and he accordingly declined to adopt any
profession. Living an almost purely intellectual life, he wrote a great
deal of prose and some poetry; and his first volume of poems appeared
before the close of the eighteenth century. His life, which began in the
reign of George III., stretched through the reigns of George IV. and
William IV., into the twenty-seventh year of Queen Victoria; and, in the
course of this long life, he had manifold experiences, many loves and
hates, friendships and acquaintanceships, with persons of every sort and
rank. He joined the Spanish army to fight Napoleon, and presented the
Spanish Government with large sums of money. He spent about thirty years
of his life in Florence, where he wrote many of his works. He died at
Florence in the year 1864. His greatest prose work is the <b>Imaginary
Conversations</b>; his best poem is <b>Count Julian</b>; and the
character of Count Julian has been
<span class = "pagenum">348</span>

ranked by De Quincey with the Satan of Milton. Some of his smaller
poetic pieces are perfect; and there is one, <b>Rose Aylmer</b>, written
about a dear young friend, that Lamb was never tired of
repeating:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">

<span class = "smallcaps">Jane Austen</span> (<b>1775-1817</b>), the
most delicate and faithful painter of English social life, was born at
Steventon, in Hampshire, in 1775&mdash;in the same year as Landor and
Lamb. She wrote a small number of novels, most of which are almost
perfect in their minute and true painting of character. Sir Walter
Scott, Macaulay, and other great writers, are among her fervent
admirers. Scott says of her writing: “The big bow-wow strain I can do
myself, like any now going; but the exquisite touch which renders
ordinary commonplace things and characters interesting, from the truth
of the description and the sentiment, is denied to me.” She works out
her characters by making them reveal themselves in their talk, and by an
infinite series of minute touches. Her two best novels are <b>Emma</b>
and <b>Pride and Prejudice</b>. The interest of them depends on the
truth of the painting; and many thoughtful persons read through the
whole of her novels every year.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Thomas De Quincey</span> (<b>1785-1859</b>),
one of our most brilliant essayists, was born at Greenhays, Manchester,
in the year 1785. He was educated at the Manchester grammar-school and
at Worcester College, Oxford. While at Oxford he took little share in
the regular studies of his college, but read enormous numbers of Greek,
Latin, and English books, as his taste or whim suggested. He knew no
one; he hardly knew his own tutor. “For the first two years of my
residence in Oxford,” he says, “I&nbsp;compute that I did not utter one
hundred words.” After leaving Oxford, he lived for about twenty years in
the Lake country; and there he became acquainted with Wordsworth,
Hartley Coleridge (the son of S.&nbsp;T. Coleridge), and John Wilson
(afterwards known as
<span class = "pagenum">349</span>
<!--png 167-->
Professor Wilson, and also as the “Christopher North” of ‘Blackwood’s
Magazine’). Suffering from repeated attacks of neuralgia, he gradually
formed the habit of taking laudanum; and by the time he had reached the
age of thirty, he drank about 8000 drops a-day. This unfortunate habit
injured his powers of work and weakened his will. In spite of it,
however, he wrote many hundreds of essays and articles in reviews and
magazines. In the latter part of his life, he lived either near or in
Edinburgh, and was always employed in dreaming (the opium increased his
power both of dreaming and of musing), or in studying or writing. He
died in Edinburgh in the year 1859.&mdash;Many of his essays were
written under the signature of “The English Opium-Eater.” Probably his
best works are <b>The Confessions of an Opium-Eater</b> and <b>The
Vision of Sudden Death</b>. The chief characteristics of his style are
majestic rhythm and elaborate eloquence. Some of his sentences are
almost as long and as sustained as those of Jeremy Taylor; while, in
many passages of reasoning that glows and brightens with strong passion
and emotion, he is not inferior to Burke. He possessed an enormous
vocabulary&mdash;in wealth of words and phrases he surpasses both
Macaulay and Carlyle; and he makes a very large&mdash;perhaps even an
excessive&mdash;use of Latin words. He is also very fond of using
metaphors, personifications, and other figures of speech. It may be said
without exaggeration that, next to Carlyle’s, De Quincey’s style is the
most stimulating and inspiriting that a young reader can find among
modern writers.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Thomas Carlyle</span> (<b>1795-1881</b>), a
great thinker, essayist, and historian, was born at Ecclefechan, in
Dumfriesshire, in the year 1795. He was educated at the burgh school of
Annan, and afterwards at the University of Edinburgh. Classics and the
higher mathematics were his favourite studies; and he was more
especially fond of astronomy. He was a teacher for some years after
leaving the University. For a few years after this he was engaged in
minor literary work; and translating from the German occupied a good
deal of his time. In 1826 he married Jane Welsh, a&nbsp;woman of
abilities only inferior to his own. His first original work was
<b>Sartor Resartus</b> (“The Tailor Repatched”), which appeared in 1834,
and excited a great deal of attention&mdash;a&nbsp;book which has proved
to many the electric spark which first woke into life their powers of
thought and reflection. From 1837 to 1840 he gave courses of lectures in
London; and these lectures were listened to by the best and most
thoughtful of the London people. The most striking series afterwards
appeared in the form of a book, under the title of <b>Heroes
<span class = "pagenum">350</span>
<!--png 168-->
and Hero-Worship</b>. Perhaps his most remarkable book&mdash;a&nbsp;book
that is unique in all English literature&mdash;is <b>The French
Revolution</b>, which appeared in 1837. In the year 1845, his
<b>Cromwell’s Letters and Speeches</b> were published, and drew after
them a large number of eager readers. In 1865 he completed the hardest
piece of work he had ever undertaken, his <b>History of
Frederick&nbsp;II., commonly called the Great</b>. This work is so
highly regarded in Germany as a truthful and painstaking history that
officers in the Prussian army are obliged to study it, as containing the
best account of the great battles of the Continent, the fields on which
they were fought, and the strategy that went to win them. One of the
crowning external honours of Carlyle’s life was his appointment as Lord
Rector of the University of Edinburgh in 1866; but at the very time that
he was delivering his famous and remarkable Installation Address, his
wife lay dying in London. This stroke brought terrible sorrow on the old
man; he never ceased to mourn for his loss, and to recall the virtues
and the beauties of character in his dead wife; “the light of his life,”
he said, “was quite gone out;” and he wrote very little after her death.
He himself died in London on the 5th of February 1881.</p>

<b>Carlyle’s Style.</b>&mdash;Carlyle was an author by profession,
a&nbsp;teacher of and prophet to his countrymen by his mission, and a
student of history by the deep interest he took in the life of man. He
was always more or less severe in his judgments&mdash;he has been called
“The Censor of the Age,”&mdash;because of the high ideal which he set up
for his own conduct and the conduct of others.&mdash;He shows in his
historic writings a splendour of imagery and a power of dramatic
grouping second only to Shakespeare’s. In command of words he is second
to no modern English writer. His style has been highly praised and also
energetically blamed. It is rugged, gnarled, disjointed, full of
irregular force&mdash;shot across by sudden lurid lights of
imagination&mdash;full of the most striking and indeed astonishing
epithets, and inspired by a certain grim Titanic force. His sentences
are often clumsily built. He himself said of them: “Perhaps not more
than nine-tenths stand straight on their legs; the remainder are in
quite angular attitudes; a&nbsp;few even sprawl out helplessly on all
sides, quite broken-backed and dismembered.” There is no modern writer
who possesses so large a profusion of figurative language. His works are
also full of the pithiest and most memorable sayings, such as the
following:&mdash;</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Thomas Babington Macaulay</span>
(<b>1800-1859</b>), the most popular of modern historians,&mdash;an
essayist, poet, statesman, and orator,&mdash;was born at Rothley Temple,
in Leicestershire, in the year 1800. His father was one of the greatest
advocates for the abolition of slavery; and received, after his death,
the honour of a monument in Westminster Abbey. Young Macaulay was
educated privately, and then at Trinity College, Cambridge. He studied
classics with great diligence and success, but detested
mathematics&mdash;a&nbsp;dislike the consequences of which he afterwards
deeply regretted. In 1824 he was elected Fellow of his college. His
first literary work was done for Knight’s ‘Quarterly Magazine’; but the
earliest piece of writing that brought him into notice was his famous
essay on <b>Milton</b>, written for the ‘Edinburgh Review’ in 1825.
Several years of his life were spent in India, as Member of the Supreme
Council; and, on his return, he entered Parliament, where he sat as M.P.
for Edinburgh. Several offices were filled by him, among others that of
Paymaster-General of the Forces, with a seat in the Cabinet of Lord John
Russell. In 1842 appeared his <b>Lays of Ancient Rome</b>, poems which
have found a very large number of readers. His greatest work is his
<b>History of England from the Accession of James II</b>. To enable
himself to write this history he read hundreds of books, Acts of
Parliament, thousands of pamphlets, tracts, broadsheets, ballads, and
other flying fragments of literature; and he never seems to have
forgotten anything he ever read. In. 1849 he was elected Lord Rector of
the University of Glasgow; and in 1857 was raised to the peerage with
the title of Baron Macaulay of Rothley&mdash;the first literary man who
was ever called to the House of Lords. He died at Holly Lodge,
Kensington, in the year 1859.</p>

<b>Macaulay’s Style.</b>&mdash;One of the most remarkable qualities in
his style is the copiousness of expression, and the remarkable power of
putting the same statement in a large number of different ways. This
enormous command of expression corresponded with the extraordinary power
of his memory. At the age of eight he could repeat
<span class = "pagenum">352</span>
<!--png 170-->
the whole of Scott’s poem of “Marmion.” He was fond, at this early age,
of big words and learned English; and once, when he was asked by a lady
if his toothache was better, he replied, “Madam, the agony is abated!”
He knew the whole of Homer and of Milton by heart; and it was said with
perfect truth that, if Milton’s poetical works could have been lost,
Macaulay would have restored every line with complete exactness. Sydney
Smith said of him: “There are no limits to his knowledge, on small
subjects as on great; he is like a book in breeches.” His style has been
called “abrupt, pointed, and oratorical.” He is fond of the arts of
surprise&mdash;of antithesis&mdash;and of epigram. Sentences like these
are of frequent occurrence:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quotation">
“Cranmer could vindicate himself from the charge of being a heretic only
by arguments which made him out to be a murderer.”</p>

<p class = "quotation">
“The Puritan hated bear-baiting, not because it gave pain to the bear,
but because it gave pleasure to the spectators.”</p>

<p class = "author">
Besides these elements of epigram and antithesis, there is a vast wealth
of illustration, brought from the stores of a memory which never seemed
to forget anything. He studied every sentence with the greatest care and
minuteness, and would often rewrite paragraphs and even whole chapters,
until he was satisfied with the variety and clearness of the expression.
“He could not rest,” it was said, “until the punctuation was correct to
a comma; until every paragraph concluded with a telling sentence, and
every sentence flowed like clear running water.” But, above all things,
he strove to make his style perfectly lucid and immediately
intelligible. He is fond of countless details; but he so masters and
marshals these details that each only serves to throw more light upon
the main statement. His prose may be described as pictorial prose. The
character of his mind was, like Burke’s, combative and oratorical; and
he writes with the greatest vigour and animation when he is attacking a
policy or an opinion.</p>

CHAPTER IX.</a></h4>

<h6>THE SECOND HALF OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.</h6>


<p><a name = "partIV_chapIX_sec1" id = "partIV_chapIX_sec1">1.</a>
<b>Science.</b>&mdash;The second half of the nineteenth century is
distinguished by the enormous advance made in science, and in the
application of science to the industries and occupations of the people.
Chemistry and electricity have more especially made enormous strides.
Within the last twenty years, chemistry has remade itself into a new
science; and electricity has taken a very large part of the labour of
mankind upon itself. It carries our messages round the world&mdash;under
the deepest seas, over the highest mountains, to every continent, and to
every great city; it lights up our streets and public halls; it drives
our engines and propels our trains. But the powers of imagination, the
great literary powers of poetry, and of eloquent prose,&mdash;especially
in the domain of fiction,&mdash;have not decreased because science has
grown. They have rather shown stronger developments. We must, at the
same time, remember that a great deal of the literary work published by
the writers who lived, or are still living, in the latter half of this
century, was written in the former half. Thus, Longfellow was a man of
forty-three, and Tennyson was forty-one, in the year 1850; and both had
by that time done a great deal of their best work. The same is true of
the prose-writers, Thackeray, Dickens, and Ruskin.</p>

<b>Poets and Prose-Writers.</b>&mdash;The six greatest poets of the

<span class = "smallcaps">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</span>
(<b>1807-1882</b>), the most popular of American poets, and as popular
in Great Britain as he is in the United States, was born at Portland,
Maine, in the year 1807. He was educated at Bowdoin College, and took
his degree there in the year 1825. His profession was to have been the
law; but, from the first, the whole bent of his talents and character
was literary. At the extraordinary age of eighteen the professorship of
modern languages in his own college was offered to him; it was eagerly
accepted, and in order to qualify himself for his duties, he spent the
next four years in Germany, France, Spain, and Italy. His first
important prose work was <b>Outre-Mer</b>, or a <b>Pilgrimage beyond the
Sea</b>. In 1837 he was offered the Chair of Modern Languages and
Literature in Harvard University, and he again paid a visit to
Europe&mdash;this time giving his thoughts and study chiefly to Germany,
Denmark, and Scandinavia. In 1839 he published the prose romance called
<b>Hyperion</b>. But it was not as a prose-writer that Longfellow gained
the secure place he has in the hearts of the English-speaking peoples;
it was as a poet. His first volume of poems was called <b>Voices of the
Night</b>, and appeared in 1841; Evangeline was published in 1848; and
<b>Hiawatha</b>, on which his poetical reputation is perhaps most firmly
based, in 1855. Many other volumes of poetry&mdash;both original and
translations&mdash;have also come from his pen; but these are the best.
The University of Oxford created him Doctor of Civil Law in 1869. He
died at Harvard in the year 1882. A&nbsp;man of singularly mild and
gentle character, of sweet and charming manners, his own lines may be
applied to him with perfect appropriateness&mdash;</p>

<b>Longfellow’s Style.</b>&mdash;In one of his prose works, Longfellow
himself says, “In character, in manners, in style, in all things, the
<span class = "pagenum">355</span>
<!--png 173-->
supreme excellence is simplicity.” This simplicity he steadily aimed at,
and in almost all his writings reached; and the result is the sweet
lucidity which is manifest in his best poems. His verse has been
characterised as “simple, musical, sincere, sympathetic, clear as
crystal, and pure as snow.” He has written in a great variety of
measures&mdash;in more, perhaps, than have been employed by Tennyson
himself. His “Evangeline” is written in a kind of dactylic hexameter,
which does not always scan, but which is almost always musical and
impressive&mdash;</p>

He is always careful and painstaking with his rhythm and with the

<span class = "smallcaps">Alfred Tennyson</span>, a great English poet,
who has written beautiful poetry for more than fifty years, was born at
Somersby, in Lincolnshire, in the year 1809. He is the youngest of three
brothers, all of whom are poets. He was educated at Cambridge, and some
of his poems have shown, in a striking light, the forgotten beauty of
the fens and flats of Cambridge and Lincolnshire. In 1829 he obtained
the Chancellor’s medal for a poem on “Timbuctoo.” In 1830 he published
his first volume, with the title of <b>Poems chiefly
Lyrical</b>&mdash;a&nbsp;volume which contained, among other beautiful
verses, the “Recollections of the Arabian Nights” and “The Dying Swan.”
In 1833 he issued another volume, called simply <b>Poems</b>; and this
contained the exquisite poems entitled “The Miller’s Daughter” and “The
Lotos-Eaters.” <b>The Princess</b>, a&nbsp;poem as remarkable for its
striking thoughts as for its perfection of language, appeared in 1847.
The <b>In Memoriam</b>, a&nbsp;long series of short poems in memory of
his dear friend, Arthur Henry Hallam, the son of Hallam the historian,
was published in the year 1850. When Wordsworth died in 1850, Tennyson
was appointed to the office of Poet-Laureate. This office, from the time
when Dryden was forced to resign it in 1689, to the
<span class = "pagenum">356</span>
<!--png 174-->
time when Southey accepted it in 1813, had always been held by third or
fourth rate writers; in the present day it is held by the man who has
done the largest amount of the best poetical work. <b>The Idylls of the
King</b> appeared in 1859. This series of poems&mdash;perhaps his
greatest&mdash;contains the stories of “Arthur and the Knights of the
Round Table.” Many other volumes of poems have been given by him to the
world. In his old age he has taken to the writing of ballads and dramas.
His ballad of <b>The Revenge</b> is one of the noblest and most vigorous
poems that England has ever seen. The dramas of <b>Harold</b>, <b>Queen
Mary</b>, and <b>Becket</b>, are perhaps his best; and the last was
written when the poet had reached the age of seventy-four. In the year
1882 he was created Baron Tennyson, and called to the House of
Peers.</p>

<b>Tennyson’s Style.</b>&mdash;Tennyson has been to the last two
generations of Englishmen the national teacher of poetry. He has tried
many new measures; he has ventured on many new rhythms; and he has
succeeded in them all. He is at home equally in the slowest, most
tranquil, and most meditative of rhythms, and in the rapidest and most
impulsive. Let us look at the following lines as an example of the
first. The poem is written on a woman who is dying of a lingering
disease&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“Fair is her cottage in its place,</p>
<p class = "two">
Where yon broad water sweetly slowly glides:</p>
<p>It sees itself from thatch to base</p>

Dream in the sliding tides.</p>
<p class = "stanza">
“And fairer she: but, ah! how soon to die!</p>
<p class = "two">
Her quiet dream of life this hour may cease:</p>
<p>Her peaceful being slowly passes by</p>
<p class = "two">
To some more perfect peace.”</p>
</div>

<p class = "author">
The very next poem, “The Sailor Boy,” in the same volume,
is&mdash;though written in exactly the same measure&mdash;driven on with
the most rapid march and vigorous rhythm&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“He rose at dawn and, fired with hope,</p>
<p class = "two">
Shot o’er the seething harbour-bar,</p>
<p>And reached the ship and caught the rope</p>
<p class = "two">
And whistled to the morning-star.”</p>
</div>

<p class = "author">
And this is a striking and prominent characteristic of all Tennyson’s
poetry. Everywhere the sound is made to be “an echo to the sense”; the
style is in perfect keeping with the matter. In the “Lotos-Eaters,” we
have the sense of complete indolence and deep repose in&mdash;</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Elizabeth Barrett Barrett</span>, afterwards
<span class = "smallcaps">Mrs&nbsp;Browning</span>, the greatest poetess
of this century, was born in London in the year 1809. She wrote verses
“at the age of eight&mdash;and earlier,” she says; and her first volume
of poems was published when she was seventeen. When still a girl, she
broke a blood-vessel upon the lungs, was ordered to a warmer climate
than that of London; and her brother, whom she loved very dearly, took
her down to Torquay. There a terrible tragedy was enacted before her
eyes. One day the weather and the water looked very tempting; her
brother took a sailing-boat for a short cruise in Torbay; the boat went
down in front of the house, and in view of his sister; the body was
never recovered. This sad event completely destroyed her already weak
health; she returned to London, and spent several years in a darkened
room. Here she “read almost every book worth reading in
<span class = "pagenum">358</span>
<!--png 176-->
almost every language, and gave herself heart and soul to that poetry of
which she seemed born to be the priestess.” This way of life lasted for
many years: and, in the course of it, she published several volumes of
noble verse. In 1846 she married Robert Browning, also a great poet. In
1856 she brought out <b>Aurora Leigh</b>, her longest, and probably also
her greatest, poem. Mr&nbsp;Ruskin called it “the greatest poem which
the century has produced in any language;” but this is going too
far.&mdash;Mrs&nbsp;Browning will probably be longest remembered by her
incomparable sonnets and by her lyrics, which are full of pathos and
passion. Perhaps her two finest poems in this kind are the <b>Cry of the
Children</b> and <b>Cowper’s Grave</b>. All her poems show an enormous
power of eloquent, penetrating, and picturesque language; and many of
them are melodious with a rich and wonderful music. She died in
1861.</p>

Transcriber’s Note:<br>
The above paragraph is given as printed. Elizabeth Barrett Browning was
born Elizabeth Barrett Moulton, later Moulton-Barrett, in 1806. Her year
of birth was universally given as 1809 until some time after Robert
Browning’s death. Her brother’s fatal accident took place in 1840.

<span class = "smallcaps">Robert Browning</span>, the most daring and
original poet of the century, was born in Camberwell, a&nbsp;southern
suburb of London, in the year 1812. He was privately educated. In 1836
he published his first poem <b>Paracelsus</b>, which many wondered at,
but few read. It was the story of a man who had lost his way in the
mazes of thought about life,&mdash;about its why and
wherefore,&mdash;about this world and the next,&mdash;about himself and
his relations to God and his fellow-men. Mr&nbsp;Browning has written
many plays, but they are more fit for reading in the study than for
acting on the stage. His greatest work is <b>The Ring and the Book</b>;
and it is most probably by this that his name will live in future ages.
Of his minor poems, the best known and most popular is <b>The Pied Piper
of Hamelin</b>&mdash;a&nbsp;poem which is a great favourite with all
young people, from the picturesqueness and vigour of the verse. The most
deeply pathetic of his minor poems is <b>Evelyn Hope</b>:&mdash;</p>

<b>Browning’s Style.</b>&mdash;Browning’s language is almost always very
hard to understand; but the meaning, when we have got at it, is well
worth all the trouble that may have been taken to reach it. His poems
are more full of thought and more rich in experience than those of any
other English writer except Shakspeare. The thoughts and emotions which
throng his mind at the same moment so crowd upon and jostle each other,
become so inextricably intermingled, that it is very often extremely
difficult for us to make out
<span class = "pagenum">359</span>
<!--png 177-->
any meaning at all. Then many of his thoughts are so subtle and so
profound that they cannot easily be drawn up from the depths in which
they lie. No man can write with greater directness, greater lyric
vigour, fire, and impulse, than Browning when he chooses&mdash;write
more clearly and forcibly about such subjects as love and war; but it is
very seldom that he does choose. The infinite complexity of human life
and its manifold experiences have seized and imprisoned his imagination;
and it is not often that he speaks in a clear, free voice.</p>

was born near London in the year 1834. He was educated at Marlborough
and at Exeter College, Oxford. In 1858 appeared his first volume of
poems. In 1863 he began a business for the production of artistic
wall-paper, stained glass, and furniture; he has a shop for the sale of
these works of art in Oxford Street, London; and he devotes most of his
time to drawing and designing for artistic manufacturers. His first
poem, <b>The Life and Death of Jason</b>, appeared in 1867; and his
magnificent series of narrative poems&mdash;<b>The Earthly
Paradise</b>&mdash;was published in the years from 1868 and 1870. ‘The
Earthly Paradise’ consists of twenty-four tales in verse, set in a
framework much like that of Chaucer’s ‘Canterbury Tales.’ The poetic
power in these tales is second only to that of Chaucer; and Morris has
always acknowledged himself to be a pupil of Chaucer’s&mdash;</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">William Makepeace Thackeray</span>
(<b>1811-1863</b>), one of the most original of English novelists, was
born at Calcutta in the year 1811. The son of a gentleman high in the
civil service of the East India Company, he was sent to England to be
educated, and was some years at Charterhouse School, where one of his
schoolfellows was Alfred Tennyson. He then went on to the University of
Cambridge, which he left without taking a degree. Painting was the
profession that he at first chose; and he studied art both in France and
Germany. At the age of twenty-nine, however, he discovered that he was
on a false tack, gave up painting, and took to literary work as his true
field. He contributed many pleasant articles to ‘Fraser’s Magazine,’
under the name of <b>Michael Angelo Titmarsh</b>; and one of his most
beautiful and most pathetic stories, <b>The Great Hoggarty Diamond</b>,
was also written under this name. He did not, however, take his true
place as an English novelist of the first rank until the year 1847, when
he published his first serial novel, <b>Vanity Fair</b>. Readers now
began everywhere to class him with Charles Dickens, and even above him.
His most beautiful work is perhaps <b>The Newcomes</b>; but the work
which exhibits most fully the wonderful power of his art and his
intimate knowledge of the spirit and the details of our older English
life is <b>The History of Henry Esmond</b>&mdash;a&nbsp;work written in
the style and language of the days of Queen Anne, and as beautiful as
anything ever done by Addison himself. He died in the year 1863.</p>

most popular writer of
<span class = "pagenum">362</span>
<!--png 180-->
this century, was born at Landport, Portsmouth, in the year 1812. His
delicate constitution debarred him from mixing in boyish sports, and
very early made him a great reader. There was a little garret in his
father’s house where a small collection of books was kept; and, hidden
away in this room, young Charles devoured such books as the ‘Vicar of
Wakefield,’ ‘Robinson Crusoe,’ and many other famous English books. This
was in Chatham. The family next removed to London, where the father was
thrown into prison for debt. The little boy, weakly and sensitive, was
now sent to work in a blacking manufactory at six shillings a-week, his
duty being to cover the blacking-pots with paper. “No words can
express,” he says, “the secret agony of my soul, as I compared these my
everyday associates with those of my happier childhood, and felt my
early hopes of growing up to be a learned and distinguished man crushed
in my breast.... The misery it was to my young heart to believe that,
day by day, what I had learned, and thought, and delighted in, and
raised my fancy and my emulation up by, was passing away from me, never
to be brought back any more, cannot be written.” When his father’s
affairs took a turn for the better, he was sent to school; but it was to
a school where “the boys trained white mice much better than the master
trained the boys.” In fact, his true education consisted in his eager
perusal of a large number of miscellaneous books. When he came to think
of what he should do in the world, the profession of reporter took his
fancy; and, by the time he was nineteen, he had made himself the
quickest and most accurate&mdash;that is, the best reporter in the
Gallery of the House of Commons. His first work, <b>Sketches by Boz</b>,
was published in 1836. In 1837 appeared the <b>Pickwick Papers</b>; and
this work at once lifted Dickens into the foremost rank as a popular
writer of fiction. From this time he was almost constantly engaged in
writing novels. His <b>Oliver Twist</b> and <b>David Copperfield</b>
contain reminiscences of his own life; and perhaps the latter is his
most powerful work. “Like many fond parents,” he wrote, “I&nbsp;have in
my heart of hearts a favourite child; and his name is <i>David
Copperfield</i>.” He lived with all the strength of his heart and soul
in the creations of his imagination and fancy while he was writing about
them; he says himself, “No one can ever believe this narrative, in the
reading, more than I believed it in the writing;” and each novel, as he
wrote it, made him older and leaner. Great knowledge of the lives of the
poor, and great sympathy with them, were among his most striking gifts;
and Sir Arthur Helps goes so far as to say, “I&nbsp;doubt much whether
there has ever been a writer of fiction who took such a real and living
<span class = "pagenum">363</span>
<!--png 181-->
interest in the world about him.” He died in the year 1870, and was
buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<b>Dickens’s Style.</b>&mdash;His style is easy, flowing, vigorous,
picturesque, and humorous; his power of language is very great; and,
when he is writing under the influence of strong passion, it rises into
a pure and noble eloquence. The scenery&mdash;the external circumstances
of his characters, are steeped in the same colours as the characters
themselves; everything he touches seems to be filled with life and to
speak&mdash;to look happy or sorrowful,&mdash;to reflect the feelings of
the persons. His comic and humorous powers are very great; but his
tragic power is also enormous&mdash;his power of depicting the fiercest
passions that tear the human breast,&mdash;avarice, hate, fear, revenge,
remorse. The great American statesman, Daniel Webster, said that Dickens
had done more to better the condition of the English poor than all the
statesmen Great Britain had ever sent into the English Parliament.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">John Ruskin</span>, the greatest living master
of English prose, an art-critic and thinker, was born in London in the
year 1819. In his father’s house he was accustomed “to no other prospect
than that of the brick walls over the way; he had no brothers, nor
sisters, nor companions.” To his London birth he ascribes the great
charm that the beauties of nature had for him from his boyhood: he felt
the contrast between town and country, and saw what no country-bred
child could have seen in sights that were usual to him from his infancy.
He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, and gained the Newdigate prize
for poetry in 1839. He at first devoted himself to painting; but his
true and strongest genius lay in the direction of literature. In 1843
appeared the first volume of his <b>Modern Painters</b>, which is
perhaps his greatest work; and the four other volumes were published
between that date and the year 1860. In this work he discusses the
qualities and the merits of the greatest painters of the English, the
Italian, and other schools. In 1851 he produced a charming fairy tale,
‘The King of the Golden River, or the Black Brothers.’ He has written on
architecture also, on political economy, and on many other social
subjects. He is the founder of a society called “The St&nbsp;George’s
Guild,” the purpose of which is to spread abroad sound notions of what
true life and true art are, and especially to make the life of the poor
more endurable and better worth living.</p>

similes are daring, but always true. Speaking of the countless statues
that fill the innumerable niches of the cathedral of Milan, he says that
“it is as though a flight of angels had alighted there and been struck
to marble.” His writings are full of the wisest sayings put into the

“Every act, every impulse, of virtue and vice, affects in any creature,

be it ever so little a one; and persistent vicious living and following
of pleasure render, after a certain number of generations, all art

gravity proceeding from dulness and mere incapability of enjoyment,
which is most base.”</p>

His power of painting in words is incomparably greater than that of any
other English author: he almost infuses colour into his words and
phrases, so full are they of pictorial power. It would be impossible to
give any adequate idea of this power here; but a few lines may suffice
for the present:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quotation">
“The noonday sun came slanting down the rocky slopes of La Riccia, and
its masses of enlarged and tall foliage, whose autumnal tints were mixed
with the wet verdure of a thousand evergreens, were penetrated with it
as with rain. I&nbsp;cannot call it colour; it was conflagration.
Purple, and crimson, and scarlet, like the curtains of God’s tabernacle,
the rejoicing trees sank into the valley in showers of light, every
separate leaf quivered with buoyant and burning life; each, as it turned
to reflect or to transmit the sunbeam, first a torch and then an
emerald.”</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">George Eliot</span> (the literary name for
<b>Marian Evans, 1819-1880</b>), one of our greatest writers, was born
in Warwickshire in the year 1819. She was well and carefully educated;
and her own serious and studious character made her a careful thinker
and a most diligent reader. For some time the famous Herbert Spencer was
her tutor; and under his care her mind developed with surprising
rapidity. She taught herself German, French, Italian&mdash;studied the
best works in the literature of these languages; and she was also fairly
mistress of Greek and Latin. Besides all these, she was an accomplished
musician.&mdash;She was for some time assistant-editor of the
‘Westminster Review.’ The first of her works which called the
<span class = "pagenum">365</span>
<!--png 183-->
attention of the public to her astonishing skill and power as a novelist
was her <b>Scenes of Clerical Life</b>. Her most popular novel, <b>Adam
Bede</b>, appeared in 1859; <b>Romola</b> in 1863; and
<b>Middlemarch</b> in 1872. She has also written a good deal of poetry,
among other volumes that entitled <b>The Legend of Jubal, and other
Poems</b>. One of her best poems is <b>The Spanish Gypsy</b>. She died
in the year 1880.</p>

<b>George Eliot’s Style.</b>&mdash;Her style is everywhere pure and
strong, of the best and most vigorous English, not only broad in its
power, but often intense in its description of character and situation,
and always singularly adequate to the thought. Probably no novelist knew
the English character&mdash;especially in the Midlands&mdash;so well as
she, or could analyse it with so much subtlety and truth. She is
entirely mistress of the country dialects. In humour, pathos, knowledge
of character, power of putting a portrait firmly upon the canvas, no
writer surpasses her, and few come near her. Her power is sometimes
almost Shakespearian. Like Shakespeare, she gives us a large number of
wise sayings, expressed in the pithiest language. The following are a
few:&mdash;</p>

In the last half of this sentence, all the essential

<i>Chair</i> is the Norman-French form of the French <i>chaise</i>. The

The word <i>faith</i> is a true French word with an English
ending&mdash;the ending <b>th</b>. Hence it is a hybrid. The old French
word was <i>fei</i>&mdash;from the Latin <i>fidem</i>; and the ending
<b>th</b> was added to make it look more like <i>truth</i>,
<i>wealth</i>, <i>health</i>, and other purely English words.</p>

Professor Max Müller gives this as the most remarkable instance of
cutting down. The Latin <i>mea domina</i> became in French

Milton says, in one of his sonnets&mdash;</p>

“New Presbyter is but old Priest writ large.”</p>

<p>From the etymological point of view, the truth is just the other way
about. <i>Priest</i> is old <i>Presbyter</i> writ small.</p>

An Introduction to the Study of Robert Browning’s Poetry. By <span class
= "smallcaps">Hiram Corson</span>, LL.D., Professor of Rhetoric and
English Literature in the Cornell University. 5¼ by 7½ inches. × + 338
pages. Cloth. Price by mail, $1.50; Introduction price, $1.40.</p>


<p>The purpose of this volume is to afford some aid and guidance to the
study of Robert Browning’s Poetry, which being the most complexly
subjective of all English poetry, is, for that reason alone, the most
difficult. And then the poet’s favorite art form, the dramatic, or
rather psychologic, monologue, which is quite original with himself, and
peculiarly adapted to the constitution of his genius, and to the
revelation of themselves by the several “dramatis personæ,” presents
certain structural difficulties, but difficulties which, with an
increased familiarity, grew less and less. The exposition presented in
the Introduction, of its constitution and skilful management, and the
Arguments given to the several poems included in the volume, will, it is
hoped, reduce, if not altogether remove, the difficulties of this kind.
In the same section of the Introduction certain peculiarities of the
poet’s diction, which sometimes give a check to the reader’s
understanding of a passage, are presented and illustrated.</p>

<p>It is believed that the notes to the poems will be found to cover all
points and features of the texts which require explanation and
elucidation. At any rate, no real difficulties have been wittingly
passed&nbsp;by.</p>

<p>The following Table of Contents will give a good idea of the plan and
scope of the work:&mdash;</p>

<i>From</i> <b>Albert S. Cook</b>, <i>Professor of English Literature in
the University of California</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Among American expositors of Browning, Professor Corson is easily
first. He has not only satisfied the English organization which devotes
itself to the study of the poet, but, what is perhaps a severer test, he
attracts the reader to whom Browning is only a name, and, in the compass
of one small volume, educates him into the love and appreciation of the
poet. If Browning is to be read in only a single volume, this, in my
opinion, is the best; if he is to be studied zealously and exhaustively,
Professor Corson’s book is an excellent introduction to the complete
series of his works.</p>

<p class = "space">
<i>From</i> <b>The Critic</b>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Ruskin, Browning, and Carlyle all have something in common:
a&nbsp;vast message to deliver, a&nbsp;striking way of delivering it,
and an over-mastering spirituality. In none of them is there mere
smooth, smuck surface: all are filled with the fine wrinkles of thought
wreaking itself on expression with many a Delphic writhing.
A&nbsp;priest with a message cares little for the vocal vehicle; and yet
the utterances of all three men are beautifully melodious. Chiefest of
them all in his special poetic sphere appears to be Browning, and to him
Professor Corson thinks our special studies should be directed. This
book is a valuable contribution to Browning lore, and will doubtless be
welcomed by the Browning clubs of this country and England. It is easy
to see that Professor Corson is more than an annotator: he is a poet
himself, and on this account he is able to interpret Browning so
sympathetically.</p>

<p class = "space">
<i>From</i> <b>The Unitarian Review</b>, <i>Boston, March,
1887</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>More than almost any other poet, Browning&mdash;at least, his
reader&mdash;needs the help of a believing, cheery, and enthusiastic
guide, to beguile the weary pilgrimage.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">Ad 3</span>
<!--png 205-->

<p>There is, as we have intimated, a fast-growing esoteric literature of
exposition and comment,&mdash;part of it simply the expression of the
disciple’s loyal homage, part of it designed to win and educate the
reluctant Philistine intellect to the comforts of a true faith. In the
latter class we reckon the excellent work of Professor Corson, of
Cornell University. More than half of it is, as it should be, made up of
a selection from the shorter poems, giving each complete; while these
include what is perhaps the most readable and one of the most
characteristic of the narrative pieces, “The Flight of the Duchess,”
with which a beginner may well make his first attempt.</p>

<p class = "space">
<i>From</i> <b>The Christian Union</b>, <i>New York</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Browning, like every other great original artist, has been compelled
to wait upon the slow processes by which his own public has been
educated.</p>

<p>It is doubtful if any other single work on Browning deserves to rank
with this, with the exception of Professor Dowden’s striking comparative
study of Browning and Tennyson. Professor Corson’s elucidation of the
idea of personality in art as embodied in Mr. Browning’s poetry is the
most luminous, the most adequate, and the most thoroughly helpful
article that has ever been written on Browning’s poetry. Those who study
it carefully will discern in it a rare insight into the workings of one
of the most subtle of modern minds, and a singularly clear and complete
statement of the philosophy of life at which that mind has arrived. The
chapters on Browning’s obscurity and on his use of the dramatic
monologue are also extremely suggestive and helpful; the selections from
Browning’s poems are admirably chosen, and, with the notes, make the
best of all possible introductions to the study of Browning.</p>

<p class = "space">
<i>From</i> <b>Rev. Francis Tiffany</b>, <i>in “The Boston Herald,” Nov.
30, 1886</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>The volume is well worthy the serious study of thinking men and
women, for it embodies the results of years, not only of thorough
investigation, but of the finest poetical appreciation. From beginning
to end, it is pervaded with a fervid feeling that not to know Robert
Browning is to lose something.</p>

<p>Professor Corson, in his chapter on “Browning’s Obscurity,” has done
his best to smooth the path of the reader by explaining, and
<span class = "pagenum">Ad 4</span>
<!--png 206-->
so removing from his way, those grammatical obstructions, habits of word
inversion and baffling ellipses that stand as a lion in the path to so
many of the poet’s untried readers. This chapter is exceedingly well
wrought out, and, once carefully studied, with the illustrations given,
can hardly fail to banish many a perplexity.</p>

<p class = "space">
<i>From</i> <b>The American</b>, <i>Philadelphia</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Can Browning be made intelligible to the common mind? Ten years ago
it was assumed that he could not. But of late years a different view has
begun to prevail. And as all those who have addressed themselves
seriously to the study of Browning report themselves as having found him
repay the trouble he gave them, there has arisen very naturally an
ambition to share in their fruitful experience. Hence the rise of
Browning Societies on both sides of the Atlantic, and in the publication
of analyses and discussions of his poems, and the preparation of such
manuals as this of Professor Hiram Corson’s.</p>

<p>Professor Corson is a Browningite of the first era. He owes nothing
but encouragement to the new enthusiasm which has gathered around the
writings of the Master, whom he recognized as such long before he had
begun to attain any general recognition of his masterfulness. Browning
has helped him to a deeper sense of the spiritual life present in the
older current of English poetry. He finds in him the “subtlest assertor
of the soul in song,” and the noblest example of the spiritual element
in our modern verse. He thinks that no greater mistake has been made
with regard to him, than to treat him merely as the most intellectual of
our poets. He is that, but far more; he is the most spiritual of our
poets also.</p>

<p>All or nearly all his poems are character-studies of the deeper sort,
and hence the naturalness with which they fall into the form of dramatic
monologues. It is true, as Mr. Corson says, that the liberties our poet
takes in the collocation of words, the complexity of constructions, and
some of his verbal liberties, are of a nature to increase the difficulty
the careless reader finds. But there are poems and passages of his which
present none of these minor stumbling-blocks, but of which no reader
will make anything until he has acquired the poet’s interest in
personality, its God-given mission as a force for the world’s
regeneration, and its innate intimacy with divine forces. But we believe
that with Mr. Corson’s aids&mdash;notes as well as preliminary
analyses&mdash;they can be mastered by any earnest student; and
certainly few things in literature so well repay the trouble.</p>

<p><b>F. A. March</b>, <i>Prof. in Lafayette Coll</i>.: Let me
congratulate you on having brought out so eloquent a book, and acute, as
Professor Corson’s Browning. I&nbsp;hope it pays as well in money as it
must in good name.</p>

<p><b>Rev. Joseph Cook</b>, <i>Boston</i>: Professor Corson’s
Introduction to Robert Browning’s Poetry appears to me to be admirably
adapted to its purposes. It forms an attractive porch to a great and
intricate cathedral.
<span class = "gap">(<i>Feb.&nbsp;21,&nbsp;1887.</i>)</span></p>

<p><b>Louise M. Hodgkins</b>, <i>Prof. of English Literature, Wellesley
Coll.</i>: I&nbsp;consider it the most illuminating textbook which has
yet been published on Browning’s poems.
<span class = "gap">(<i>March&nbsp;12,&nbsp;1887.</i>)</span></p>

<p><b>F. H. Giddings</b>, in <i>“The Paper World,” Springfield,
Mass.</i>: It is a stimulating, wisely helpful book. The arguments of
the poems are explained in luminous prose paragraphs that take the
reader directly into the heart of the poet’s meaning. Chapters on
Browning’s obscurity and Browning’s verse clear away, or rather show the
reader how to overcome by his own efforts, the admitted difficulties
presented by Browning’s style. These chapters bear the true test; they
enable the attentive reader to see, as Professor Corson sees, that such
features of Browning’s diction are seldom to be condemned, but often
impart a peculiar crispness to the expressions in which they occur.</p>

<p>The opening chapter of the book is the finest, truest introduction to
the study of English literature, as a whole, that any American writer
has yet produced.</p>

<p>This chapter leads naturally to a profound and noble essay, of which
it would be impossible to convey any adequate conception in a paragraph.
It prepares the reader for an appreciation of Browning’s loftiest work.
<span class = "gap">(<i>March,&nbsp;1887.</i>)</span></p>
</td>

<td>
<p><b>Melville B. Anderson</b>, <i>Prof. of English Literature, Purdue
Univ., in “The Dial,” Chicago</i>: The arguments to the poems are made
with rare judgment. Many mature readers have hitherto been repelled from
Browning by real difficulties such as obstruct the way to the inner
sanctuary of every great poet’s thought. Such readers may well be glad
of some sort of a path up the rude steeps the poet has climbed and
whither he beckons all who can to follow him.
<span class = "gap">(<i>January,&nbsp;1887.</i>)</span></p>

<p><b>Queries</b>, <i>Buffalo, N.Y.</i>: It is the most noteworthy
treatise on the poetry of Browning yet published. Professor Corson is
well informed upon the poetic literature of the age, is an admirably
clear writer, and brings to the subject he has in hand ample knowledge
and due&mdash;we had almost said undue&mdash;reverence. It has been a
labor of love, and he has performed it well. The book will be a popular
one, as readers who are not familiar with or do not understand
Browning’s poetry either from incompetency, indolence, or lack of time,
can here gain a fair idea of Browning’s poetical aims, influence, and
works without much effort, or the expense of intellectual effort.
Persons who have made a study of Browning’s poetry will welcome it as a
matter of course.
<span class = "gap">(<i>December,&nbsp;1886.</i>)</span></p>

<p><b>Education</b>, <i>Boston</i>: Any effort to aid and guide the
young in the study of Robert Browning’s poetry is to be commended. But
when the editor is able to grasp the hidden meaning and make conspicuous
the poetic beauties of so famous an author, and, withal, give such
clever hints, directions, and guidance to the understanding and the
enjoyment of the poems, he lays us all under unusual obligations. It is
to be hoped that this book will come into general use in the high
schools, academies, and colleges of America. It is beautifully printed,
in clear type, on good paper, and is well bound.

<h3>The Study of English.</h3>

<hr>

<p class = "book">
Practical Lessons in the Use of English.<br>
For Primary and Grammar Schools. By <span class = "smallcaps">Mary F.
Hyde</span>, Teacher of Composition in the State Normal School, Albany,
N.Y.</p>

<p>This work consists of a series of <i>Practical Lessons</i>, designed
to aid the pupil in his own use of English, and to assist him in
understanding its use by others. No topic is introduced for study that
does not have some practical bearing upon one or the other of these two
points.</p>

<p>The pupil is first led to observe certain facts about the language,
and then he is required to apply those facts in various exercises. At
every step in his work he is compelled to think.</p>

<p>The Written Exercises are a distinctive feature of this work. These
exercises not only give the pupil daily practice in using the knowledge
acquired, but lead him to form the habit of independent work.</p>

<p>Simple exercises in composition are given from the first. In these
exercises the aim is not to train the pupil to use any set form of
words, but so to interest him in his subject, that, when writing, he
will think simply of what he is trying to say.</p>

<p>Special prominence is given to letter-writing and to written forms
relating to the ordinary business of life.</p>

<p>The work will aid teachers as well as pupils. It is so arranged that
even the inexperienced teacher will have no difficulty in awakening an
interest in the subjects presented.</p>

<p>This series consists of three parts (in two volumes), the lessons
being carefully graded throughout:&mdash;</p>

sound training as the ancient languages or the other

modern languages would give; and that the study of English forms,
idioms, historical grammar, etc., is the only linguistic discipline
possible to the great masses of our pupils, and that it is entirely
adequate to the results required of it as such. He dwells especially on
the disciplinary value of the analytical method as applied to the
elucidation of English syntax, and the striking adaptation of English
constructions to the exact methods of logical analysis. This Monograph
discusses English teaching in the entire range of its disciplinary uses
from primary school to high collegiate work.

English in the Preparatory Schools.<br>
By <span class = "smallcaps">Ernest W. Huffcut</span>, Instructor in
Rhetoric in the Cornell University.</p>

<p>The aim of this Monograph is to present as simply and practically as
possible some of the advanced methods of teaching English grammar and
English composition in the secondary schools. The author has kept
constantly in mind the needs of those teachers who, while not giving
undivided attention to the teaching of English, are required to take
charge of that subject in the common schools. The defects in existing
methods and the advantages of fresher methods are pointed out, and the
plainest directions given for arousing and maintaining an interest in
the work and raising it to its true place in the school curriculum.

The Study of Rhetoric in the College Course.<br>
By <span class = "smallcaps">J. F. Genung</span>, Professor of Rhetoric
in Amherst College.</p>

<p>This book is the outcome of the author’s close and continued inquiry
into the scope and limits of rhetorical study as pursued by
undergraduates, and of his application of his ideas to the organization
of a progressive rhetorical course. The first part defines the place of
rhetoric among the college studies, and the more liberal estimate of its
scope required by the present state of learning and literature. This is
followed by a discussion of what may and should be done, as the most
effective practical discipline of students toward the making of
literature. Finally, a&nbsp;systematized and progressive course in
rhetoric is sketched, being mainly the course already tried and approved
in the author’s own classes.

<h4>THE STUDENT’S OUTLINE HISTORICAL</h4>

<p><i>The attention of teachers is invited to the following features of
this Map:</i></p>

<p>1. It emphasizes the vital connection (too often neglected) between
History and Geography.</p>

<p>2. It leads the student through “the eye gate” into the fair fields
of English History.</p>

<p>3. It gives a local habitation to his often vague ideas of time and
place.</p>

<p>4. It serves as an historical laboratory, in which he makes practical
application of acquired facts, in accordance with the most approved
method of teaching History.</p>

<p>5. It presents a <i>few</i> prominent facts, to which he is to add
others <i>singly</i> and <i>consecutively</i>.</p>

<p><i>In particular:</i></p>

<p>1. The exhibition, side by side, of different periods illustrates by
the approximate identity of boundaries a real historical unity of
development.</p>

<p>2. The student’s attention is called to the culmination of Saxon
England, and the overweening power and disintegrating tendencies of the
great earldoms just before the Norman conquest, as marking the
turning-point of English History.</p>

<p>3. The water-shed has been sufficiently indicated by the insertion of
a few rivers.</p>

<p>4. As an aid to the memory, the modern counties are grouped under the
divisions of Saxon England.</p>

<p>5. Special attention is called to the insertion of Cathedral towns,
as touching upon the ecclesiastical history of England.</p>

<p>6. This Map can be used effectively with a class in English
Literature, to record an author’s birthplace, the scene of a story,
poem, or drama, etc.</p>
